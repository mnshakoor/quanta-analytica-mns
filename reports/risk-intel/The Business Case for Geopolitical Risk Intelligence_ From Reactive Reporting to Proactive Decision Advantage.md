# **The Business Case for Geopolitical Risk Intelligence: From Reactive Reporting to Proactive Decision Advantage**

### **By M. Nuri Shakoor, Lladner Business Systems for IOSI Global Multidimension Task Force**

### **1.0 The Modern Imperative: Navigating a Fractured and Volatile Global Landscape**

Geopolitical risk is no longer a niche concern reserved for periodic board briefings but has evolved into a standing operational issue for all global organizations. The modern international environment is characterized by fragmentation, strategic competition, and rapid, cascading disruptions. This necessitates a more dynamic and integrated approach to risk management, as geopolitical risk has moved from a topic for occasional review to a core concern embedded in executive decision cycles.

This reality, which a reality Seerist terms a 'new normal' where continual volatility and chaos are the baseline conditions, is reflected in the World Economic Forum's *Global Risks Report 2025*, which identifies geopolitical tension as a leading near-term concern for global decision-makers. In this environment, a single event can trigger immediate and far-reaching consequences. A localized trade restriction can become a supply shock, a reputational shock, and a compliance shock simultaneously, compressing leadership decision timelines from weeks to days. This convergence of threats demands a specialized discipline designed to manage this new reality.

### **2.0 Defining Geopolitical Risk Intelligence: A New Capability for a New Era**

To effectively manage this new class of risk, leadership must first understand the distinct discipline of Geopolitical Risk Intelligence. It is a fundamental departure from traditional, static approaches that are no longer sufficient for today's dynamic threat environment. At its core, this capability provides a continuous, forward-looking view of external threats, enabling organizations to move from a reactive posture to one of proactive readiness.

A formal working definition clarifies its purpose and scope:

"A continuous, requirements-driven capability that collects, fuses, and analyzes external geopolitical, security, and political signals to deliver decision-ready assessments and early warning for protecting people, operations, and assets, and for enabling strategic adaptation."

This intelligence-led approach stands in sharp contrast to the insufficiency of static risk registers. While a risk register documents known risks at a single point in time, a live intelligence function actively *manages* risk by providing continuous sensing of a streaming, ever-changing environment. It is the difference between having a map and having a live navigation system. The "requirements-driven" nature of the capability ensures it is focused on specific, high-stakes decisions, such as, “Should we suspend operations in Province X within 72 hours?” or “How exposed are we to sanctions expansion on shipping services in Corridor Y?”

The core value proposition is not the impossible goal of perfect prediction, but a fundamental shift in executive mindset. It moves leadership from asking "What will happen?" to asking the far more manageable and strategic question, "What are our options if X, Y, or Z happens?" The goal is achieving **"decision advantage under uncertainty,"** which materializes in four distinct ways:

* **Reduce Surprise:** Enable the earlier detection of material changes in the operating environment, giving leadership more time to prepare and respond.  
* **Accelerate Response:** Shorten the critical time between the initial detection of a geopolitical signal and decisive executive action.  
* **Clarify Trade-offs:** Provide sharper attribution of the drivers, actors, and causal pathways behind a threat, improving the quality of strategic decisions.  
* **Institutionalize Learning:** Create a systematic feedback loop where every disruption, crisis, and near-miss strengthens the organization's future performance and resilience.

This capability is built upon a foundation of integrated professional disciplines that give it structure, rigor, and strategic alignment.

### **3.0 The Three Pillars of a Mature Capability**

A robust Geopolitical Risk Intelligence capability cannot exist in a silo. Its organizational power is derived from the integration of three distinct professional domains: governance, analytical discipline, and a forward-looking perspective. By connecting these pillars, the function moves beyond simple reporting to become a core part of the organization's strategic nervous system.

* **3.1 Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Governance Alignment**  
  * To be effective, the intelligence function cannot be a rogue commentary shop; it must be anchored in the organization's formal governance structures. Aligning with established frameworks like COSO ERM and ISO 31000 ensures that intelligence work maps directly to strategic objectives and the board's stated risk appetite. This connection guarantees that insights are relevant to high-stakes decisions and that the function operates with clear board-level oversight.  
* **3.2 Intelligence Tradecraft and Analytic Discipline**  
  * Intelligence tradecraft provides the discipline required to turn raw information into reliable decision support. Central to this pillar is the use of **Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs)**, as highlighted in the U.S. Government's *Tradecraft Primer*. These formal methods are designed to reduce cognitive biases, surface hidden assumptions, and make analytical judgments transparent and auditable—which is critical for defending high-stakes decisions to the board and regulators.  
* **3.3 Strategic Foresight and Horizon Scanning**  
  * This pillar shifts the function's focus from reactive to proactive. As defined by the OECD, strategic foresight is not about prediction; it is a structured approach to exploring plausible futures to better prepare for change. The foundational process of horizon scanning systematically identifies emerging issues and weak signals at the margins of current planning. Integrating foresight transforms the intelligence function from one that asks "what happened?" to one that asks, "what could happen next, and what options should we have ready?"

With these conceptual pillars as a foundation, we now turn to the disciplined operating model that brings this capability to life.

### **4.0 The Operating Model: The Geopolitical Risk Intelligence Lifecycle**

The power of geopolitical risk intelligence lies in its disciplined, repeatable process. The intelligence lifecycle is a continuous, six-step operating model that systematically transforms raw data into decision advantage. This structured process makes the function's activities transparent, manageable, and consistently focused on delivering value to decision-makers.

1. **Direction & Requirements:** The lifecycle begins not with data, but with a clear understanding of the specific decisions leaders need to make. This stage focuses on defining Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) that are tied to concrete organizational risks and decision timelines.  
2. **Collection & Sensing:** With clear requirements defined, the next step is to gather decision-relevant information. This involves blending structured data (e.g., economic indices, sanctions lists) with unstructured signals (e.g., local media reports, policy speeches) to achieve comprehensive coverage.  
3. **Processing & Exploitation:** This is the critical technical bridge between collection and analysis. Raw information is made usable through activities like translation, source evaluation, geocoding, and cleaning. It is a common point of failure, as poor processing corrupts the quality of all subsequent analysis.  
4. **Analysis & Production:** In this core intellectual stage, processed information is transformed into actionable judgments. Analysts use Structured Analytic Techniques to produce assessments, scenarios, likelihood ranges, and leading indicators. The goal is to connect the dots and create a coherent picture of risks and opportunities.  
5. **Dissemination & Decision Integration:** More than just sending a report, this step is about delivering the right insight to the right decision-maker at the right time. To be effective, intelligence must be integrated into the organization's existing operational rhythms, such as crisis management calls and executive risk committee meetings.  
6. **Evaluation & Learning:** The final stage closes the loop, making the process self-improving. It involves conducting after-action reviews to assess what worked and what did not. This feedback is used to refine indicators, test assumptions, and ensure the capability matures and learns from every event.

The following table summarizes the core purpose and key outcome of each stage in the lifecycle.

| Stage | Core Purpose | Key Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Direction** | To define the specific decisions that need to be made. | Clearly defined priority intelligence requirements. |
| **2\. Collection** | To gather the information needed to answer the key questions. | Decision-relevant coverage of structured and unstructured data. |
| **3\. Processing** | To make raw information clean, organized, and usable for analysis. | Normalized, translated, and validated information. |
| **4\. Analysis** | To transform processed information into actionable judgments and insights. | Actionable assessments, scenarios, and leading indicators. |
| **5\. Dissemination** | To deliver the right insight to the right person at the right time. | Timely, integrated decision support for leadership. |
| **6\. Evaluation** | To learn from past performance and improve the process over time. | Refined indicators, reduced bias, and improved decision quality. |

This disciplined lifecycle is not a theoretical exercise; it delivers tangible value by directly addressing core business vulnerabilities in areas like supply chain integrity and sanctions exposure.

### **5.0 Strategic Applications: Translating Insight into Business Value**

A mature geopolitical risk intelligence process translates directly into the protection of personnel, operations, assets, and strategic positioning. The capability delivers tangible value by providing decision-makers across key business functions with the foresight needed to navigate complex external threats.

* **Supply Chain and Corridor Resilience** Geopolitical shocks often manifest first as logistics friction. As documented by both UNCTAD and the IMF, security disruptions in major waterways like the Red Sea can rapidly reshape maritime networks and increase costs. An intelligence function supports supply chain leaders through the disciplined application of the lifecycle: the **Collection** step actively monitors chokepoints for disruption indicators, while the **Analysis** step provides scenarios to support decisions on corridor switching and inventory management.  
* **Sanctions, Compliance, and Economic Coercion** Sanctions regimes are a primary tool of statecraft, imposing binding legal constraints. A geopolitical intelligence capability is the direct mechanism for navigating this dynamic landscape. The **Analysis** step, using Structured Analytic Techniques, maintains a live map of sanctions exposure, while the **Dissemination** step ensures that timely assessments reach executive risk committees. This disciplined process, emphasized by regulators like OFAC, prevents costly compliance failures, such as those illustrated by the EU's expanded sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet."  
* **Personnel Risk and Duty of Care** For organizations with a global workforce, the intelligence function is a crucial duty-of-care instrument. It provides the analytical basis for travel risk assessments and establishes data-driven triggers for evacuations or hibernation protocols. The **Direction** and **Dissemination** steps of the lifecycle ensure that the protection of personnel is guided by specific, timely intelligence rather than by lagging, reactive crisis response.  
* **Strategy and Market Access under Fragmentation** The capability also informs long-term strategic decisions. The World Bank's analysis of "friendshoring" highlights how strategic competition is reshaping global investment patterns. Geopolitical risk intelligence, integrating the **Strategic Foresight** pillar and the scenario analysis produced in the **Analysis** step, helps leaders reassess regional investment logic and anticipate where regulatory and political risks may compound, ensuring long-range strategy is grounded in a realistic appraisal of the global landscape.

### **6.0 Conclusion: Building a Compounding Advantage Through Foresight**

Geopolitical risk intelligence is a continuous operating capability that transforms external volatility into internal readiness. By integrating the governance of enterprise risk management with the rigor of the intelligence cycle and the forward-looking perspective of foresight, it equips an organization to not merely survive, but to gain an advantage in an increasingly fractured world. It is a competitive weapon in an era of geoeconomic statecraft.

The ultimate payoff is not the unachievable promise of perfect prediction. It is **strategic foresight**—the ability to see plausible threat pathways sooner, prepare options in advance, and respond with speed and legitimacy when disruptions arrive. Organizations that invest in this capability develop a learning system that refines alerts, tests assumptions, and stress-tests scenarios. Over time, this learning creates a compounding advantage, building a form of operational resilience that competitors cannot easily copy.

# Annex A. The Six Distinct Risk Families

The discipline of geopolitical risk intelligence is defined by a comprehensive scope that addresses the complexities of a fragmented international system. To provide operational clarity, the discipline covers at least **six distinct risk families** that impact an organization's personnel, operations, assets, and strategic options.

### **1\. Conflict and Political Violence Risk**

This family encompasses threats arising from both state and non-state actors that result in physical instability. It specifically includes:

* **State conflict:** Large-scale warfare between nations.  
* **Insurgency and Terrorism:** Targeted violence by non-state groups against governments or civilians.  
* **Civil Unrest:** Protests, riots, or internal strikes that disrupt local environments. Organizations often monitor these patterns using high-frequency event datasets to detect escalation patterns, such as geographic spread or the diversification of involved actors.

### **2\. Economic Coercion and Policy Shock Risk**

This category focuses on the use of economic tools by states to achieve political or strategic goals. Key elements include:

* **Sanctions and Tariffs:** Financial and trade restrictions designed to pressure specific regimes or entities.  
* **Export Controls:** Limitations on the transfer of sensitive technologies or goods.  
* **Forced Localization:** Government policies requiring companies to produce goods or store data within a specific jurisdiction. These risks are often tracked through news coverage of geopolitical tensions and adverse policy events.

### **3\. Supply Chain and Corridor Disruption Risk**

This risk family addresses the physical and logistical "friction" that occurs in global trade networks. It involves monitoring:

* **Maritime Chokepoints:** Strategic waterways where disruptions can halt global traffic.  
* **Port Restrictions:** Administrative or security-related delays at major transit hubs.  
* **Insurance Repricing:** Increased costs for cargo or vessel insurance due to heightened security threats in specific corridors, such as the Red Sea.

### **4\. Regulatory and Compliance Exposure**

Unlike general market conditions, this family deals with legal and administrative obligations that can shift rapidly based on geopolitical developments. It includes:

* **Sanctions Compliance Obligations:** The requirement to adhere to evolving lists of restricted counterparties and jurisdictions.  
* **Licensing and Due Diligence:** The legal necessity of screening partners and securing government permissions for international operations. Recent examples include expanded sanctions targeting "shadow fleets" in maritime ecosystems, which require organizations to maintain live maps of their compliance exposure.

### **5\. Reputational and Information Risk**

This family concerns the intangible but critical area of organizational legitimacy. It covers:

* **Disinformation:** The deliberate spread of false information to undermine an organization or government.  
* **Perception Operations:** Strategic efforts by actors to influence how an organization is viewed by the public or its stakeholders. Monitoring these risks often requires validating unstructured data from social platforms and local media to surface "weak signals" of shifting narratives.

### **6\. Macro-Structural Change**

This category focuses on long-term, systemic shifts in the global order that alter the basic assumptions of international business. Key themes include:

* **Geopolitical Fragmentation:** The breaking down of global systems into competing blocs.  
* **Friendshoring:** The redirection of supply chains and investments toward politically allied nations.  
* **Bloc Formation:** The creation of exclusive economic or political groups that affect market access and regional hub strategies.

**To better understand these families, imagine an organization as a large castle: Conflict risk is a direct siege on the walls; Economic Coercion is an attempt to block the local market; Supply Chain risk is a landslide on the only road leading to the gates; Regulatory exposure is a sudden change in the kingdom's laws; Reputational risk is a rumor spread in the village about the castle's owner; and Macro-Structural change is a shift in the very borders of the kingdom itself.**

# Annex B. **The geopolitical risk intelligence lifecycle**

The primary objective of the **geopolitical risk intelligence lifecycle** is to create a **continuous decision-advantage loop** that transforms external volatility into internal readiness. Rather than focusing on narrow or precise predictions, the lifecycle is designed to help organizations navigate uncertainty by providing earlier detection of material changes, sharper attribution of drivers, and faster operational adaptation.

The specific objectives of this lifecycle can be categorized into the following strategic goals:

### **1\. Achieving Decision Advantage under Uncertainty**

The "core value" of the lifecycle is not just to provide information, but to offer a **decision advantage**. This involves:

* **Reducing Surprise:** By maintaining a "live sensing" system, the lifecycle aims to identify threats before they become crises.  
* **Shortening Decision Latency:** A critical objective is to reduce the time between the detection of a signal and the execution of an executive action.  
* **Improving Trade-offs:** It provides the necessary context for leaders to make higher-quality choices and trade-offs when faced with ambiguous geopolitical developments.

### **2\. Detection, Interpretation, and Anticipation of Threats**

The lifecycle establishes a structured process to monitor a fragmented international system. Its objectives in this area include:

* **Continuous Sensing:** Using a mix of structured data (indices, trade flows) and unstructured signals (social media, policy speeches) to detect external threats arising from **political conflict, state behavior, and economic coercion**.  
* **Atypical Pattern Recognition:** Utilizing machine-assisted **anomaly detection** to identify deviations from baseline patterns, such as sudden shifts in protest geography or abnormal shipping route changes.  
* **Anticipating Cascading Disruptions:** Understanding how a localized security incident can trigger simultaneous shocks in supply chains, compliance, and reputation.

### **3\. Mapping Geopolitical Signals to Organizational Exposure**

The lifecycle aims to bridge the gap between global events and local impacts. Key objectives here include:

* **Clarifying Causal Pathways:** Intelligence must explicitly link geopolitical events to an organization's specific exposure, such as its growth markets, logistics corridors, or regulatory permissions.  
* **Protecting Core Assets:** The lifecycle provides **decision-ready assessments** and early warnings specifically for the protection of an organization’s personnel, operations, and physical or digital assets.  
* **Maintaining Compliance:** It serves as a tool for managing **sanctions and regulatory risk**, keeping a live map of exposure to evolving services restrictions and "shadow fleet" ecosystems.

### **4\. Enabling Strategic Foresight and Adaptation**

Beyond reactive monitoring, the lifecycle is designed to facilitate **strategic foresight**.

* **Exploring Plausible Futures:** Using horizon scanning and scenario generation to identify "signposts of change" and explore various future pathways.  
* **Preparing Options in Advance:** The objective is to move from improvisation to preparation by establishing **pre-approved triggers** for actions such as evacuations, contingency supplier activation, or corridor switching.

### **5\. Institutionalizing Organizational Learning**

A unique objective of the geopolitical risk intelligence lifecycle is the **compounding of organizational knowledge**.

* **Feedback and Evaluation:** The final stage of the lifecycle involves after-action reviews to test which indicators worked and where biases may have affected judgments.  
* **Maturation of Capability:** By evaluating decisions against actual outcomes, the organization ensures that its risk management capabilities improve over time, turning every disruption into a source of future resilience.

**The geopolitical risk intelligence lifecycle functions like an advanced flight navigation system: it doesn't just show you the weather (Information); it calculates how that weather will impact your specific flight path (Interpretation), alerts you to turbulence before you hit it (Early Warning), and suggests alternative routes to ensure you reach your destination safely (Strategic Adaptation).**

# Annex C. Measuring Geopolitical Risk Intelligence and Decision Impact

According to the sources, a mature geopolitical risk intelligence function should be measured by its **decision impact** rather than the sheer volume of content it produces. The primary goal of these metrics is to determine if the function provides a **"decision advantage"** by reducing surprise and shortening the time between the detection of a threat and the execution of a response.

The sources identify the following specific metrics used to evaluate performance:

### **Core Operational Metrics**

* **Time-to-Detection:** This measures **how quickly a material change is identified** in the external environment relative to an organization's peers.  
* **Decision Latency Reduction:** This tracks the **time elapsed from the issuance of an alert to the final executive decision**. One of the core purposes of the intelligence discipline is to shorten this window to allow for faster operational adaptation.  
* **Calibration:** This metric evaluates whether the **probability ranges** assigned to various risks by analysts are realistic and accurate when measured against actual outcomes over time.  
* **False Positive Burden:** This measures the "noise" generated by the function. It assesses **how many alerts were triggered for events that did not materialize** or did not require action, which helps ensure that executive attention is not wasted.  
* **Action Adoption Rate:** This identifies whether the **intelligence recommendations provided are actually utilized** by decision-makers and, if not, analyzes the reasons behind the lack of adoption.  
* **Post-Event Learning Rate:** This measures **how quickly indicators, playbooks, and mitigation strategies improve** following a disruption. This is critical for "institutionalizing learning" so that every incident strengthens future resilience.

### **Strategic and Qualitative Metrics**

Beyond numerical tracking, the sources suggest that the quality of the intelligence function should be judged on its **analytic rigor and transparency**. Key qualitative standards include:

* **Clarity of Assumptions:** Assessing whether the underlying beliefs behind an assessment are clearly stated and tested.  
* **Evidence Traceability:** Measuring the strength of the **logic chain** that links a specific signal (like a policy shift or a troop movement) to a concrete organizational implication.  
* **Counterfactual Value:** This is often considered the **highest-value metric**, though it is difficult to quantify. it asks whether the intelligence function **prevented an avoidable loss, reduced operational downtime, or preserved strategic options** that would have otherwise been lost.

### **Integration with Governance**

Finally, the effectiveness of the function is reflected in its integration into **executive and board-level reporting**. Performance is demonstrated through the delivery of:

* **Exposure Concentration Maps:** Visual tools that show where the organization’s assets or supply chains are most vulnerable.  
* **Signpost Monitoring:** Identifying the specific triggers that indicate a shift in the risk landscape, allowing leadership to move from "what happened" to **"what could happen next"**.

**Measuring an intelligence function is like evaluating a ship's radar system: you don't judge its value by how many blips it shows on the screen, but by how much earlier it spots a reef compared to other ships, how quickly the captain can turn the wheel after an alert, and whether the ship successfully avoids the rocks that others might have hit.**
