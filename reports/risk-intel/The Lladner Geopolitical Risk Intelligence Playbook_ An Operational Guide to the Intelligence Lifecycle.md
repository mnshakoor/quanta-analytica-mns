# **The Lladner Geopolitical Risk Intelligence Playbook: An Operational Guide to the Intelligence Lifecycle**

### **Foreword by M. Nuri Shakoor**

In a world increasingly defined by fragmentation, strategic competition, and cascading disruption, the ability to understand and anticipate geopolitical risk is no longer a niche capability reserved for governments or the largest multinationals. It has become a core requirement for organizational resilience. For any organization with personnel, operations, supply chains, or compliance postures exposed to external shocks, geopolitical risk intelligence is now an essential discipline.

This playbook is designed to demystify that discipline by providing a practical, non-academic operating model for building and executing a continuous, decision-focused geopolitical risk intelligence function. The central philosophy of this guide is that the value of this capability lies not in the futile pursuit of perfect prediction, but in providing **decision advantage under uncertainty**.

Our goal is to equip your organization with a systematic process to reduce surprise, shorten the time between the detection of a critical signal and the execution of a defensible action, and institutionalize learning from every disruption. By rigorously applying the intelligence lifecycle detailed within these pages, your organization can transform external volatility into internal readiness, building a durable strategic advantage that allows you to anticipate change, adapt faster than your peers, and make informed choices when the stakes are highest.

## **1.0 Foundations: Defining Geopolitical Risk Intelligence as a Core Capability**

### **1.1 Setting the Stage: Why This Discipline Matters**

In today's interconnected global landscape, establishing a formal geopolitical risk intelligence function has become a strategic imperative. The speed and complexity of modern risks have rendered outdated, static approaches like periodic country risk reports insufficient. A localized security incident can now trigger simultaneous global shocks across supply chains, compliance frameworks, and corporate reputations within days. This reality demands a live, operational capability that can sense and interpret change as it happens. Geopolitical risk intelligence acts like a **high-powered lighthouse for a global ship**; it scans the distant horizon for gathering storms and shifting tides, allowing leadership to adjust course long before the vessel encounters rough water, enabling the organization to prepare rather than simply react.

### **1.2 What is Geopolitical Risk Intelligence?**

Geopolitical Risk Intelligence is a continuous, requirements-driven capability that collects, fuses, and analyzes external geopolitical, security, and political signals to deliver decision-ready assessments and early warning. Its primary mission is to protect an organization's people, operations, and assets while enabling strategic adaptation to a changing world. This methodology is a corporate adaptation of the same structured, repeatable intelligence cycle used by national intelligence agencies, such as the one defined by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence \[7\].

A critical distinction must be made between raw "information" and finished "intelligence." Information is data in its unprocessed state. Intelligence, by contrast, is information that has been processed and analyzed specifically for decision use, aligned with the structured, repeatable methodology of the intelligence cycle. A geopolitical risk function that produces generic content without being tied to specific decisions is merely an information service; a true intelligence function delivers outcomes.

### **1.3 The Three Conceptual Pillars**

A mature geopolitical risk intelligence capability must be built upon the integrated foundation of three conceptual pillars. When built separately, they fail to reinforce each other; when integrated, they create a powerful and resilient function.

1. **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Governance:** Aligning the intelligence function with established frameworks like ISO 31000 and COSO ERM anchors its work in the organization's strategic objectives and board-level oversight. This connection ensures that intelligence efforts are mapped directly to concrete business decisions, risk appetite, and formal governance controls, preventing the function from becoming an isolated academic exercise.  
2. **Intelligence Tradecraft and Analytic Discipline:** The credibility of an intelligence function comes from the clarity of its logic, not the rhetorical confidence of its delivery. The use of structured analytic techniques is essential for reducing cognitive bias, surfacing hidden assumptions, and improving the transparency and rigor of analytic judgments. This discipline ensures that assessments are evidence-based, traceable, and defensible under scrutiny.  
3. **Strategic Foresight and Horizon Scanning:** Strategic foresight is not about prediction; it is a structured approach for exploring plausible futures to prepare for change. Integrating foresight methods like horizon scanning shifts the function from reactive reporting ("what happened") to proactive preparation ("what could happen next, through which pathways, and what options should we have ready?"). This pillar moves the organization beyond simply managing today's risks to actively shaping its readiness for tomorrow's challenges.

The practical application of these pillars is realized through the disciplined execution of the intelligence lifecycle.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2.0 The Geopolitical Risk Intelligence Lifecycle: A Continuous Loop**

### **2.1 Overview of the Six-Step Process**

The geopolitical risk intelligence lifecycle is a structured, six-step process that systematically transforms raw data into a decision advantage. It is not a linear checklist but a continuous, iterative loop designed for constant improvement. Each stage feeds into the next, and the final step, Evaluation, provides critical feedback that is fed back into the first step, Direction. This ensures the capability matures over time, learning from every cycle to become more accurate, efficient, and impactful.

### **2.2 Lifecycle Summary**

The following table summarizes the six stages of the intelligence lifecycle, outlining the core purpose and key outcome of each step.

| Stage | Core Purpose | Key Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Direction** | To define the specific decisions that need to be made. | A charter of agreed-upon PIRs that prevents generic monitoring and focuses all effort on decision advantage. |
| **2\. Collection** | To gather the information needed to answer the key questions. | A curated, multi-source body of information directly tailored to the PIRs, achieving decision-relevant coverage. |
| **3\. Processing** | To make raw information clean, organized, and usable for analysis. | A validated, organized, and analyzable dataset, forming the high-quality raw material for credible judgments. |
| **4\. Analysis** | To transform processed information into actionable judgments and insights. | Finished intelligence products containing clear, defensible, and forward-looking judgments ready for decision-makers. |
| **5\. Dissemination** | To deliver the right insight to the right person at the right time. | Timely and integrated decision support, measured by whether intelligence was received, understood, and used to inform a decision. |
| **6\. Evaluation** | To learn from past performance and improve the process over time. | A compounding advantage of institutional learning that builds a more resilient organization. |

We will now examine each of these steps in detail.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3.0 Step 1: Direction & Requirements – Asking the Right Questions**

### **3.1 Establishing the Core Purpose**

The Direction and Requirements phase is the most critical step in the entire intelligence lifecycle. An intelligence effort that begins without clear direction is destined to produce content that is merely interesting rather than essential. This stage aligns the entire function with specific, high-stakes organizational decisions. The process begins not with data, but with a clear understanding of what leaders must decide, the timelines for those decisions, and the level of uncertainty they can accept.

### **3.2 Key Activities and Techniques**

* **Identify Key Stakeholders:** The first activity is to engage directly with decision-makers across the organization. This requires active collaboration with executive leadership and functional heads in departments such as supply chain, corporate security, legal, and compliance to understand their operational rhythms, decision points, and primary concerns, which is essential for translating vague anxieties into concrete intelligence needs.  
* **Formulate Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs):** Vague concerns like "what's happening in Country X?" must be refined into specific, time-bound, and decision-relevant questions. These PIRs become the mandate for the intelligence team. Well-formed PIRs are unambiguous and directly tied to a potential action. Examples include:  
  * *“Should we suspend operations in Province X within 72 hours?”*  
  * *“How exposed are we to sanctions expansion on shipping services in Corridor Y?”*  
  * *“Which markets face the highest probability of regulatory restriction on data localization in the next 12 months?”*

### **3.3 Critical Outcomes**

The primary outcome of this stage is a clearly defined and agreed-upon set of Priority Intelligence Requirements. These PIRs act as the charter for the rest of the lifecycle, focusing all subsequent collection, processing, and analysis efforts. This prevents the team from drifting into generic global monitoring and ensures that every ounce of effort is dedicated to delivering a decision advantage on the issues that matter most to the organization.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4.0 Step 2: Collection & Sensing – Gathering the Puzzle Pieces**

### **4.1 Establishing the Core Purpose**

Once the key questions are defined, the Collection stage begins. The purpose of this stage is to execute a targeted plan to gather the specific information required to answer the PIRs. The guiding principle is not to accumulate the maximum amount of data, but to achieve "decision-relevant coverage." This means assembling a multi-source body of information tailored precisely to the intelligence requirements established in Step 1\.

### **4.2 Key Activities and Data Architecture**

A comprehensive intelligence picture requires blending two primary types of data sources, each providing a different but equally vital perspective.

* **Structured Data:** This refers to organized, quantitative datasets that can be easily monitored and compared. Examples include geopolitical risk indices, macroeconomic data from sources like the IMF, official government sanctions lists, commodity prices, and trade flow statistics. These sources are vital for establishing baselines, tracking trends, and enabling systematic, quantitative monitoring of the risk environment.  
* **Unstructured Signals:** This category encompasses a vast range of qualitative information that provides critical context, nuance, and early warning. Examples include local media reports in their original language, official policy speeches, social media discourse, maritime advisories, and academic analyses. These sources are crucial for capturing intent, sentiment, and the "weak signals" of change that often precede major events and are missed by structured data alone.

### **4.3 Critical Outcomes**

The successful outcome of the Collection stage is a curated, multi-source body of raw information that is directly relevant to the active PIRs. This is not an indiscriminate data dump but a targeted and thoughtful compilation of the puzzle pieces needed for analysis. This information is now ready for the crucial next step of being normalized, structured, and validated for use.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **5.0 Step 3: Processing & Exploitation – Making Information Usable**

### **5.1 Establishing the Core Purpose**

The Processing stage is the critical-but-often-overlooked bridge between raw data collection and rigorous analysis. Its purpose is to transform messy, disparate, and raw inputs into a clean, structured, and usable format. Many intelligence functions experience "silent failure" at this stage by treating processing as a mere IT detail. In reality, it is a core analytic determinant that fundamentally shapes the quality and defensibility of the final intelligence product.

### **5.2 Key Activities and Techniques**

* **Normalization:** This involves a set of technical tasks to ensure data consistency and usability. Key activities include the translation of foreign language materials, entity resolution (ensuring that a person, company, or location is identified consistently across different sources), and the geocoding of event data to assign specific geographic coordinates.  
* **Source Evaluation:** Before any piece of information enters the analytical workflow, it must be evaluated. This vital step involves systematically assessing the reliability of the source, its potential bias, and its overall credibility. This ensures that analysis is built on a foundation of validated information, not unvetted rumor.  
* **Structuring:** This is the process of preparing information for systematic analysis. For example, unstructured text from news reports or policy documents can be tagged with relevant metadata, such as topics (e.g., `sanctions`, `protest`), locations (`Port of Singapore`), and key actors (`Company X`), allowing for systematic queries and analysis.

### **5.3 Critical Outcomes**

The key outcome of this stage is a validated, organized, and analyzable dataset. This high-quality, structured information is the essential raw material for producing credible and defensible analytic judgments in the next stage. Without disciplined processing, even the most talented analysts will be working with flawed inputs, undermining the entire intelligence effort.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **6.0 Step 4: Analysis & Production – Connecting the Dots**

### **6.1 Establishing the Core Purpose**

The Analysis and Production stage is the intellectual heart of the intelligence lifecycle. It is here that processed information is transformed into actionable judgment. The purpose of this stage is to move beyond summarizing what has happened and to develop forward-looking assessments. Analysts connect disparate dots to identify patterns, assess the implications for the organization, and forecast a range of potential futures to inform decision-making.

### **6.2 Key Activities and Analytic Methods**

A high-performing intelligence team relies on a combination of disciplined methods and modern tools to produce high-quality analysis.

1. **Leveraging Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs)** SATs are formal, transparent methods designed to challenge assumptions, mitigate cognitive bias, and improve the overall rigor of intelligence analysis. Rather than relying on intuition alone, analysts use these techniques to make their thinking process explicit and defensible. Key techniques for geopolitical analysis include:  
   * **Key Assumptions Check:** Systematically identifying and questioning the unstated assumptions that underpin a particular analytic conclusion.  
   * **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH):** Evaluating multiple plausible explanations for an event against the available evidence to determine which hypothesis is most consistent.  
   * **Scenario Generation with Signpost Monitoring:** Developing several distinct, plausible future scenarios rather than a single forecast, and identifying specific "signpost" indicators that would suggest which scenario is becoming more likely over time.  
2. **The Human-Machine Partnership** Modern analytic workflows are best understood as a partnership where artificial intelligence **augments, not replaces,** human experts. AI’s role is to handle high-volume, routine data processing—such as predictive analytics and identifying anomalies in real-time—at a scale impossible for humans. This allows analysts to focus on their unique strengths: providing critical thinking, deep contextual understanding, and final ethical judgment on complex geopolitical issues.  
3. **Producing Decision-Ready Outputs** The final step in this stage is to synthesize the analysis into finished intelligence products that are directly useful for decision-makers. These are not simple summaries but are assessments that contain clear judgments. Key outputs include:  
   * **Likelihood Ranges** – *To quantify uncertainty and guide resource allocation.*  
   * **Impact Pathways** – *To map how a geopolitical event could concretely affect specific business units or operations.*  
   * **Scenarios** – To outline multiple plausible futures.  
   * **Leading Indicators** – *To serve as a tripwire for pre-planned contingency actions.*  
   * **Recommended Actions** – To tie assessments to specific triggers or thresholds.

### **6.3 Critical Outcomes**

The outcome of this stage is a set of finished intelligence products. These products are clear, defensible, and forward-looking assessments that are ready for delivery to decision-makers. They have transformed raw information into a coherent judgment about what is happening, why it matters, and what could happen next.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **7.0 Step 5: Dissemination & Decision Integration – Delivering the Insight**

### **7.1 Establishing the Core Purpose**

Effective dissemination is about far more than simply "sending a report." The purpose of this stage is to deliver the right intelligence product to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, with clear options for action. Dissemination is not a passive act of distribution; it is the active process of integrating insights directly into the organization's decision-making processes to ensure they are seen, understood, and used.

### **7.2 Key Activities and Techniques**

* **Integrate into Operational Rhythms:** To be truly effective, intelligence must flow into the existing meetings and workflows where decisions are made. This means embedding intelligence updates and briefings into crisis management calls, supply chain planning standups, executive risk committee meetings, and board reporting cycles. This makes intelligence a core part of how the organization operates, not an external commentary.  
* **Tailor Products for the Audience:** Intelligence products must be formatted for their specific audience to have maximum impact. For executive briefings, this often means using the **"bottom line up front" (BLUF)** format, which presents the most critical conclusion and its strategic implication at the very beginning. This allows senior leaders to quickly grasp the core message and its relevance to their decisions.  
* **Provide Clear Action Options:** To be actionable, intelligence must go beyond just describing a risk. Assessments should include recommended actions or decision points that are tied to specific thresholds or triggers. For example, an assessment might recommend a contingency plan be activated if a leading indicator—such as the maritime insurance premium for a key shipping lane—crosses a pre-defined threshold for more than 72 hours. This empowers leaders to act decisively and with confidence.

### **7.3 Critical Outcomes**

The primary outcome of this stage is timely and integrated decision support. Success is measured not by the number of reports sent or briefings delivered, but by whether the intelligence was received, understood, and used to inform a critical decision. When intelligence successfully shapes an action or inaction, the dissemination stage has succeeded.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **8.0 Step 6: Evaluation & Learning – Closing the Loop**

### **8.1 Establishing the Core Purpose**

The Evaluation and Learning stage is what transforms the intelligence lifecycle from a linear process into a self-improving, continuous loop. Its purpose is to systematically learn from past performance—both successes and failures—to improve the function's accuracy, efficiency, and impact over time. Without this disciplined feedback step, an intelligence function cannot mature; it is doomed to repeat its mistakes.

### **8.2 Key Activities and Performance Metrics**

* **Conduct After-Action Reviews:** Following a significant event or a key decision, the team should conduct a formal after-action review. This process is dedicated to answering critical questions about performance: Which indicators were most effective at providing early warning? Where did bias or flawed assumptions influence the analysis? Did the decisions informed by the intelligence ultimately improve outcomes?  
* **Measure Performance on Decision Impact:** An intelligence function should be measured on its impact on decisions, not on its content volume or output. Relevant performance metrics focus on outcomes and help quantify the value provided to the organization. Key metrics include:  
  * **Time-to-Detection:** *How quickly was a material change in the risk environment identified, measuring the effectiveness of the sensing function?*  
  * **Decision Latency Reduction:** *Did the intelligence shorten the time between an alert and an executive decision, measuring the function's operational tempo?*  
  * **Action Adoption Rate:** *Were the recommendations provided with the intelligence acted upon, measuring the function's relevance and influence?*

### **8.3 Critical Outcomes**

The key outcome of this stage is a set of actionable lessons that are fed directly back into the lifecycle to drive improvement. This feedback loop leads to refined indicators for collection, reduced bias in analysis, improved dissemination formats, and updated operational playbooks. Ultimately, this process of institutional learning builds a compounding advantage, creating a more resilient organization that grows stronger and smarter with every challenge it faces.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **9.0 Conclusion: Building Resilience Through Foresight**

By rigorously applying the six-step intelligence lifecycle detailed in this playbook, an organization transforms external volatility into internal readiness. The process is not about achieving perfect prediction in a chaotic world. Instead, it is about building a continuous operating capability that integrates risk governance with intelligence-cycle discipline and strategic foresight methods. This disciplined approach produces earlier warning, clearer scenario ranges, and faster, more defensible decision cycles.

The ultimate payoff is strategic foresight: the ability to see plausible threat pathways sooner, prepare options in advance, and respond with speed and legitimacy when disruptions arrive. In an era defined by geopolitical fragmentation and persistent volatility, organizations that treat geopolitical risk intelligence as a compounding operational asset will build a durable resilience that competitors cannot easily copy.
