# **How We Use Geopolitical Risk Intelligence**

## **From Conflict Systems Research to Strategic Communications and Data Journalism**

**By M. Nuri Shakoor**

Geopolitical risk intelligence is often misunderstood as a passive monitoring activity or a specialized reporting function reserved for governments and large multinationals. In practice, it is neither. As applied by Lladner Business Systems and ARAC International, geopolitical risk intelligence is an **operational discipline**. It is a way of thinking, sensing, analyzing, and communicating about complex environments where political power, violence, economics, information, and perception interact in nonlinear ways.

Our work spans two domains that are frequently treated as separate but are deeply interconnected: **Conflict Systems Research** and **Strategic Communications and Data Journalism**. In both domains, geopolitical risk intelligence provides the connective tissue that links evidence to insight, insight to decision, and decision to public understanding.

This essay explains how we apply geopolitical risk intelligence across these two areas, why the integration matters, and what differentiates our approach from traditional security analysis, country risk reporting, or narrative commentary.

## **Geopolitical Risk Intelligence as an Operating Discipline**

At Lladner Business Systems and ARAC International, we define geopolitical risk intelligence as a **continuous, decision-focused capability** rather than a product. Its purpose is not prediction in the narrow sense, but **decision advantage under uncertainty**.

This distinction matters. Conflict environments do not behave like linear systems. They evolve through feedback loops, second-order effects, and cascading failures. Elections trigger unrest. Security responses reshape legitimacy. Information campaigns alter threat perception faster than physical events. Static risk registers and episodic reports fail precisely because they freeze reality at a moment in time.

Geopolitical risk intelligence addresses this by combining three elements:

1. Intelligence-cycle discipline to structure how questions are asked and answered  
2. Systems thinking to understand how political, social, economic, and security variables interact  
3. Strategic foresight to prepare options before disruption forces improvisation

This approach underpins both how we research conflict systems and how we communicate about them publicly.

## **1\. Geopolitical Risk Intelligence in Conflict Systems Research**

### **From Events to Systems**

Traditional conflict analysis often focuses on discrete events: coups, protests, attacks, ceasefires, or elections. Our approach starts elsewhere. We treat conflict as a **system**, not a sequence of incidents.

Geopolitical risk intelligence allows us to move from asking “What happened?” to asking:

* What structural pressures are accumulating beneath the surface?  
* Which actors benefit from instability, ambiguity, or escalation?  
* What feedback loops are reinforcing violence or repression?  
* Where are the early signals that a system is approaching a threshold?

In conflict systems research, intelligence is not about secrets. It is about **pattern recognition across time, space, and domains**.

### **Indicator-Based Early Warning**

A core contribution of geopolitical risk intelligence to conflict research is **indicator discipline**. Rather than relying on intuition or headlines, we define leading, coincident, and lagging indicators tied to specific conflict pathways.

For example, in fragile or post-conflict environments, we monitor combinations of indicators such as:

* Changes in elite cohesion or judicial independence  
* Shifts in security force deployment patterns  
* Escalation in protest geography rather than protest volume  
* Narrative convergence between state messaging and coercive policy moves

Individually, none of these signals confirm instability. Taken together, they form **early warning patterns** that allow us to assess trajectory rather than react to crisis.

### **Structured Analytic Techniques and Bias Control**

Conflict analysis is especially vulnerable to bias: confirmation bias, mirror imaging, and single-story capture. We mitigate this by applying **structured analytic techniques** drawn from intelligence tradecraft.

Techniques such as key assumptions checks, competing hypotheses, and scenario signposting are not academic exercises. They force analytic transparency. They make uncertainty explicit. They allow decision-makers and stakeholders to see not only our conclusions, but how we arrived at them.

In practice, this means our conflict assessments do not claim certainty. They provide **ranges, contingencies, and decision-relevant implications**.

### **Learning Loops in Conflict Research**

Perhaps most importantly, geopolitical risk intelligence frames conflict research as a **learning system**. Every escalation, failed mediation, or unexpected stabilization is treated as feedback.

Indicators are refined. Assumptions are challenged. Models are updated.

This is how conflict systems research matures from descriptive analysis into **adaptive strategic insight**.

## **2\. Geopolitical Risk Intelligence in Strategic Communications and Data Journalism**

### **Why Strategic Communications Is an Intelligence Problem**

Information environments are now conflict environments. Narratives shape legitimacy, constrain policy options, and influence behavior long before physical force is applied.

Strategic communications and data journalism are therefore not peripheral to geopolitical risk intelligence. They are **delivery mechanisms** for sense-making.

At ARAC International and across our platforms, we apply geopolitical risk intelligence to ensure that public-facing analysis does three things:

1. Preserves analytical rigor  
2. Communicates complexity without distortion  
3. Resists narrative manipulation and oversimplification

### **From Analysis to Public Understanding**

Data journalism is often framed as storytelling with charts. Our approach is different. We treat data journalism as **analytic translation**.

Behind every visualization, editorial, or explainer lies the same intelligence workflow used in our internal assessments:

* Defined analytic questions  
* Curated and validated data sources  
* Explicit assumptions and uncertainty  
* Clear distinction between evidence and inference

This discipline prevents one of the most common failures in public analysis: mistaking correlation for causation or framing isolated data points as deterministic trends.

### **Narrative Risk and Cognitive Framing**

Geopolitical risk intelligence also informs how we assess **narrative risk**. Certain framings amplify polarization, obscure agency, or normalize violence. Others clarify accountability and systemic drivers.

In our strategic communications work, we ask:

* What frames are being promoted and by whom?  
* Which metaphors shape public interpretation of risk?  
* How does language influence perceived inevitability or legitimacy?

This is especially critical in coverage of fragile states, democratic backsliding, or armed conflict, where simplistic narratives can do real harm.

### **Editorial Integrity as a Risk Control**

A key principle across our platforms is that **editorial integrity is a risk management function**. Sensationalism creates false confidence. Over-simplification erodes trust. Politicized framing distorts analysis.

By grounding our communications in geopolitical risk intelligence, we maintain a consistent standard: evidence first, interpretation second, judgment clearly labeled.

This approach allows our work to inform policymakers, practitioners, and the public without becoming an instrument of advocacy or influence operations.

## **Why Integration Matters**

Conflict systems research and strategic communications are often separated institutionally. One is treated as analysis, the other as messaging. This separation is artificial and increasingly dangerous.

When analysis is disconnected from communication, insight remains siloed. When communication is disconnected from analysis, narratives drift toward distortion.

Geopolitical risk intelligence bridges this gap by providing a **common analytic spine**. The same discipline that informs internal assessments shapes external communication. The same indicators that drive early warning inform editorial prioritization.

The result is coherence across domains.

## **What Differentiates Our Approach**

Three characteristics distinguish how Lladner Business Systems and ARAC International apply geopolitical risk intelligence:

1. **Decision Orientation**  
   We do not analyze for analysis’ sake. Every assessment is tied to real decisions, whether operational, governance-related, or informational.  
2. **Systems Thinking**  
   We treat conflict, governance, and information as interconnected systems, not isolated domains.  
3. **Ethical Constraint**  
   Intelligence without constraint becomes manipulation. Our work explicitly separates assessment from advocacy and documents uncertainty rather than hiding it.

---

## **Conclusion: Intelligence as Public Responsibility**

Geopolitical risk intelligence is often framed as a competitive advantage. In fragile environments and contested information spaces, it is also a **public responsibility**.

When applied rigorously, it helps organizations act earlier, communicate more honestly, and avoid reinforcing the very dynamics they seek to mitigate.

In our work across conflict systems research and strategic communications, geopolitical risk intelligence is not a brand label. It is the discipline that allows us to operate with clarity in environments defined by ambiguity.

In an era of fragmentation, that clarity matters.

# The Application of Large Language Models

LLMs are not a side tool in our workflow at Lladner Business Systems and ARAC International. They function as a force multiplier across the entire Geopolitical Risk Intelligence lifecycle, especially where the workload is high-volume, multilingual, fast-moving, and cognitively noisy. The value is not “automation for its own sake.” The value is decision advantage, achieved by compressing time between signal detection, analytic judgment, and publishable outputs, while improving traceability and consistency.

Below is how customized GPTs, NotebookLM, Google Colab, and Google AI Studio operate as an integrated stack in our day-to-day work.

---

## **1\) Where LLMs sit in the Geopolitical Risk Intelligence lifecycle**

### **Direction and Requirements**

LLMs help us turn vague executive concerns into precise, decision-oriented intelligence questions.

* Convert leadership questions into Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs), secondary questions, and collection plans.  
* Draft indicator sets and signposts linked to specific risk pathways.  
* Generate structured collection checklists by domain (political, security, economic coercion, sanctions, corridor disruption, narrative risk).

Practical effect: better questions up front, less noise downstream.

### **Collection and Sensing**

LLMs assist in triage and coverage, especially for unstructured inputs.

* Rapidly summarize high-volume reporting while preserving named entities, dates, locations, and stated claims.  
* Translate and normalize foreign-language sources for initial screening.  
* Create “collection packets” by topic and geography with consistent metadata fields.

Practical effect: analysts spend time on interpretation, not repetitive reading.

### **Processing and Exploitation**

This is where workflow quality often collapses in other organizations. LLMs help prevent silent failure by making processing explicit.

* Entity resolution support (people, parties, ministries, armed groups, companies, vessels).  
* Standardized tagging and taxonomy assignment for incidents, policy moves, legal actions, and narrative themes.  
* First-pass source evaluation notes, with flags for propaganda patterns, recycled claims, or low-confidence sourcing.

Practical effect: cleaner datasets and more defensible judgments.

### **Analysis and Production**

LLMs are useful when they are constrained by method.

* Support structured analytic techniques: key assumptions checks, competing hypotheses scaffolds, premortems, scenario shells.  
* Draft implication chains: event or trend → mechanism → organizational exposure → decision options.  
* Generate multiple scenario ranges with explicit signposts and triggers.

Practical effect: better analytic discipline and more consistent output formatting across analysts.

### **Dissemination and Decision Integration**

This is where LLMs directly influence operational tempo.

* Generate BLUF briefs, board-ready memos, and executive summaries from validated analytic notes.  
* Produce tailored products by audience: security operations, compliance, program leadership, governance boards, external partners.  
* Convert internal assessments into public-facing explainer content without leaking sensitive operational details.

Practical effect: faster delivery, better alignment to audience, fewer rewrites.

### **Evaluation and Learning**

LLMs support the learning loop.

* Turn after-action reviews into updated indicator libraries, scenario signposts, and playbook revisions.  
* Maintain a reusable repository of analytic templates, best-practice phrasing, and caution notes for recurring biases.  
* Help maintain institutional memory across projects and rotations.

Practical effect: the capability compounds rather than resetting every cycle.

## **2\) What each tool contributes in our stack**

### **A) Customized GPTs**

Customized GPTs are our front-end operational assistants. Their job is to enforce consistency and reduce cognitive overhead.

We use them for:

* Standardized intake forms for new events, incidents, and emerging risks.  
* Repeatable templates for SitReps, intelligence notes, risk advisories, and editorial briefs.  
* Built-in guardrails that force good habits: confidence grading, assumptions, evidence separation, and decision relevance.

Why it matters: a customized GPT becomes a “process enforcer” that makes our outputs more uniform and auditable.

### **B) NotebookLM**

NotebookLM is our evidence-grounded synthesis environment for long documents and multi-source packs.

We use it for:

* Building topic briefings from internal documents, transcripts, and curated source sets.  
* Producing quote-safe summaries and structured extraction from long PDFs.  
* Creating rapid “what changed” updates by comparing new material against our existing baseline notes.

Why it matters: it helps keep analysis anchored to a bounded corpus, which reduces drift, hallucination risk, and accidental overreach.

### **C) Google Colab**

Colab is where we operationalize the quantitative side of geopolitical risk intelligence.

We use it for:

* Data ingestion pipelines (ACLED-style event tables, sanctions lists, shipping or trade proxies, economic indicators).  
* Cleaning, deduplication, geocoding, entity matching, and reproducible transforms.  
* Scoring models (risk matrices, early warning indicator thresholds, anomaly flags) and output tables for dashboards.  
* Generating charts, timelines, and structured exports (CSV, JSON) used downstream in products and publications.

Why it matters: it gives us reproducibility and auditability. Colab is where analysis becomes testable, not just persuasive.

### **D) Google AI Studio**

AI Studio is our prototyping and orchestration layer for model-driven workflows.

We use it for:

* Designing multi-step pipelines that chain: extraction → normalization → classification → summarization → product drafting.  
* Testing prompts and evaluation sets to ensure outputs are stable and aligned with our standards.  
* Implementing structured output formats (JSON schemas for incidents, actors, indicators, and narrative frames).  
* Building lightweight internal tools that can be shared across teams without rebuilding everything from scratch.

Why it matters: it is where we move from ad hoc prompting to production-grade workflows.

## **3\) How this stack supports our two workstreams**

### **1\) Conflict Systems Research**

LLMs help us map complex conflict environments faster without simplifying them.

* Rapid actor mapping support, especially in fragmented armed landscapes.  
* Identification of recurring drivers and feedback loops (governance, coercion, elite competition, external sponsorship, resource capture).  
* Scenario signposting that ties conflict dynamics to operational decisions (access, duty of care, supply routes, community acceptance).  
* Faster conversion of raw incident streams into system-level insights.

Net effect: we shift from event chasing to trajectory assessment.

### **2\) Strategic Communications and Data Journalism**

LLMs allow us to translate rigorous analysis into public-facing products that remain disciplined.

* Drafting explainer narratives from validated analytic notes.  
* Creating data-backed storyboards and charts supported by reproducible Colab outputs.  
* Producing multiple versions of the same story for different platforms and audiences.  
* Maintaining narrative integrity by separating what we know, what we assess, and what remains uncertain.

Net effect: we publish faster, with fewer errors, and with better consistency across platforms.

---

## **4\) Governance and risk controls for LLM use**

Because we work in sensitive analytical environments, we treat LLMs as augmenters, not arbiters.

Core controls we apply:

* Source-bounded workflows for high-stakes claims (NotebookLM or curated packs).  
* Explicit confidence grading, assumptions logs, and evidence separation.  
* Human verification for any claim that triggers operational decisions, reputational exposure, or compliance posture.  
* Structured outputs and schemas to reduce ambiguity and enforce consistency.  
* Clear handling rules for sensitive information and personally identifiable data.

This is the difference between using AI as a productivity hack and using it as an intelligence capability.

---

## **Bottom line**

Customized GPTs provide standardized analytic workflows. NotebookLM provides grounded synthesis across curated corpora. Google Colab provides reproducible quantitative processing and scoring. Google AI Studio provides orchestration and prototyping for scalable pipelines.

Together, they form a modern geopolitical risk intelligence stack that accelerates the full loop: sensing, processing, analysis, dissemination, and learning.
