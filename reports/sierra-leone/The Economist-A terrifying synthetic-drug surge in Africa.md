#### **Who**
- **Nyema**: A 25-year-old former student in Freetown, Sierra Leone, featured as the central figure. She is a recovering user of kush who first visited a youth support centre for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and has returned for addiction help.
- **Youth support centre volunteers**: Unnamed staff in Freetown providing assistance, including PrEP for HIV prevention and support for quitting synthetic drugs.
- **Affected populations**: Primarily young people in Sierra Leone, with broader implications for youth across Africa grappling with the drug surge.
- **Implied stakeholders**: Local authorities, health organizations, and policymakers struggling with enforcement, though not named specifically.

#### **What**
- **Core issue**: A rapid escalation in the use of synthetic drugs, particularly "kush," described as a highly potent and dangerous mixture.
- **Drug composition**: Kush is a derivative of cannabis combined with synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl and tramadol) and harmful chemicals like formaldehyde, making it cheap to produce but extremely addictive and toxic.
- **Personal impact**: Illustrated through Nyema's story—she risks bag searches at the support centre to hide her use and seeks help to "stay off kush."
- **Broader threat**: These drugs are fueling a public health crisis, endangering lives through overdose risks, addiction, and links to other health issues like HIV.

#### **Where**
- **Freetown, Sierra Leone**: The focal point, including a youth support centre where Nyema seeks help and a "hideout" where a young man is photographed smoking kush.
- **Africa-wide context**: The surge is framed as a continental problem, though the article centers on West Africa (Sierra Leone as the example); no other specific countries are detailed in the main narrative.

#### **When**
- **Publication timeline**: Featured in The Economist's September 6, 2025, print edition (online on September 4, 2025), reflecting a current crisis.
- **Event timeline**: Implies an ongoing and recent surge, with Nyema's story portraying immediate, personal struggles—no historical start date is specified, but it suggests acceleration in the mid-2020s amid post-pandemic vulnerabilities.

#### **How**
- **Production and composition**: Kush is created by mixing cannabis derivatives with synthetic opioids (fentanyl, tramadol) and industrial chemicals (formaldehyde), allowing for low-cost, makeshift manufacturing that's hard to trace or regulate.
- **Consumption**: Typically smoked, as seen in the photo of a young man in a Freetown hideout; users like Nyema consume discreetly to avoid detection.
- **Distribution and access**: Sold cheaply on the streets, evading traditional policing due to its synthetic, lab-made nature and small-scale production in hidden labs.
- **Policing challenges**: Enforcement is difficult because the drugs are easy to produce locally or import in small quantities, with minimal infrastructure for detection; support centres offer harm reduction like PrEP but struggle with addiction recovery.
- **User evasion**: Nyema exemplifies this by entering the centre via the back door to avoid bag searches, highlighting secrecy in use.

#### **Why**
- **Causes of the surge**: Economic factors make these drugs "cheap" and accessible to impoverished youth; their synthetic formulation allows rapid innovation by illicit producers to bypass bans on traditional narcotics.
- **Addictiveness and appeal**: The potent mix delivers an intense high, drawing in vulnerable young people like Nyema, who initially sought HIV protection but fell into addiction.
- **Policing difficulties**: Synthetic drugs are "hard to police" due to evolving recipes, cross-border smuggling, and limited resources in African nations, allowing the market to outpace regulations.
- **Impacts and urgency**: Leads to devastating health consequences (overdoses, mental health crises, HIV spread) and social fallout, described as a "terrifying" threat that could overwhelm fragile healthcare systems; the article warns of a "dangerous high" without urgent intervention.

### Key Quote from the Article
> “I don’t want them to search my bag,” [Nyema] explains... She first discovered the centre when its volunteers offered her pre-exposure prophylaxis to protect her from HIV. But today she is back for help with something else: staying off kush.

The piece positions this as an underreported crisis turning Africa's youth into casualties of global drug trends, calling for stronger international and local responses to stem the flow.
