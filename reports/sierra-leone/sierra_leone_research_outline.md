Here is an expanded research proposal draft based on your outline, with argument development and preliminary sources identified:

***

### Title

Institutional Trust and Political Stability: The Impact of Perceived Transparency and Independence in Sierra Leone’s Election Disputes

***

### I. Introduction

Sierra Leone’s democratic journey since the end of civil war in 2002 has been repeatedly shaped by challenges surrounding electoral disputes, with trust in the Electoral Commission for Sierra Leone (ECSL) and the judiciary often under question. The 2023 general elections further exposed vulnerabilities linked to the perceived lack of transparency and politicization of these institutions, as opposition parties refused to engage with judicial processes due to concerns of partiality. This research interrogates how these institutional perceptions affect citizens’ trust in democracy and contribute to the risk of political instability.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

***

### II. Literature Review

Recent studies and reports highlight several trends:

- Judicial independence is a critical pillar for election legitimacy, yet political appointments and lack of transparency erode this ideal in Sierra Leone, as seen in opposition parties’ criticism of election petition rulings.[^5][^1]
- Electoral management has improved in operational terms, but systemic issues like the non-publication of full polling station tallies and opaque results transmission processes persist, undermining broader public trust in the ECSL.[^2]
- Afrobarometer surveys record decreasing citizen trust in both electoral and judicial authorities, with growing suspicion of ethnic and regional discrimination by these institutions.[^3][^4]

***

### III. Argument

The core argument is that persistent perceptions of opacity and politicization within Sierra Leone’s electoral and judicial institutions fuel distrust in democratic processes. This, in turn, amplifies the risk of political instability through:

- Decreased opposition participation in legal resolution of election disputes[^1]
- Increased public suspicion and polarization along ethno-regional lines[^3]
- Heightened risk of extra-institutional or violent protest in the absence of credible formal redress[^4]

***

### IV. Methodology

Online research will focus on:

- Content analysis of institutional reports and media statements (CARL, CHRDI, Politico SL)[^6][^5]
- Review of election observer findings and international reform documentation (Open Government Partnership, ECOWAS, AU)[^2]
- Analysis of Afrobarometer and Freedom House survey datasets on trust and legitimacy[^4][^3]
- Coding for recurring themes: transparency, independence, process integrity, public trust

***

### V. Preliminary Sources

- Centre for Accountability and Rule of Law: Electoral justice and transparency reports[^6]
- Open Government Partnership: Electoral reform policies and independent audits[^2]
- Sierra Eye Magazine: Analyses of judicial independence and opposition grievances[^1]
- Afrobarometer: Public perception data on institutional trust and election fairness[^3][^4]
- Modern News Series: Civil society critiques on judicial transparency[^5]
- ECOWAS and AU observer reports for external legitimacy evaluations

***

### VI. Analytical Plan

- Map linkages between institutional perception, citizen trust, and risk incidents (e.g., protest, boycott, unrest) across election cycles
- Compare mitigation efforts (e.g., establishment of Ethics Units, procedural reforms) with observed trust outcomes and stability metrics

***

### VII. Conclusion and Recommendations

Findings will likely reinforce the policy imperative for robust transparency measures and further judicial reform. Recommendations will address capacity-building in results management, increased public access to electoral and judicial decisions, and regularized third-party audits to strengthen institutional independence.[^1][^2]

This draft proposal can be expanded further into annotated bibliographies, argument matrices, or section-by-section write-ups for presentation purposes.
