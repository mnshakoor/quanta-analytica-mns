# **Top-Tier Global Chokepoints: 12-Month Risk Ranking**

An analysis by Project Quanta Analytica, MNS Consulting

A forward-looking, map-oriented strategic risk ranking of the world’s most consequential chokepoints. I score each on three axes that drive systemic risk: Probability of Disruption within 12 months, Severity of Immediate Impact if disrupted, and Global Systemic Spillover across energy, food, manufacturing, and finance. Scores: 1 low to 5 critical. Numbered citations appear where claims rely on external data.

## Risk Overview

| Rank | Chokepoint | Probability | Severity | Systemic Spillover | Why it matters now |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Bab el-Mandeb \+ Suez Corridor (one operational system) | 4 | 5 | 5 | Red Sea attacks since late 2023 halved Suez traffic at times and cut Suez revenues about two-thirds in 2024, rerouting fleets around Africa with multi-week delays and higher costs \[1\]\[2\]. |
| 2 | Strait of Hormuz | 3 | 5 | 5 | About 20 percent of global petroleum liquids in 2024 and roughly one third of seaborne crude Jan–May 2025 transited Hormuz, making even brief closures energy-systemic \[3\]\[4\]. |
| 3 | Strait of Malacca | 3 | 4 | 5 | Carries roughly a quarter of world seaborne trade by some estimates, and the bulk of China’s inbound energy flows, creating Asia-centric systemic risk if constrained \[5\]\[6\]\[7\]. |
| 4 | Panama Canal | 3 | 4 | 4 | Hydrological constraints and operating policies after recent droughts kept transits below pre-drought baselines and depressed global port performance in 2024; conditions improved in 2025 but remain weather-sensitive and tariff-sensitive \[8\]\[9\]\[10\]. |
| 5 | Turkish Straits (Bosporus \+ Dardanelles) | 2 | 4 | 4 | Key outlet for Black Sea energy and grain. Disruptions amplify food and energy price volatility given ongoing Black Sea insecurity since 2022 \[11\]. |
| 6 | Strait of Gibraltar | 2 | 3 | 3 | Critical Atlantic-Mediterranean gateway. Lower probability near-term but high concentration of naval and commercial traffic makes it strategically sensitive. |
| 7 | Taiwan Strait | 2 | 4 | 4 | A high-volume container lane intersecting great-power competition. Escalation risks are episodic, but consequence magnitude is high if realized \[6\]. |

# **Notes on the Scoring Logic**

* **Probability** reflects near-term threat activity, physical constraints, and policy volatility.

* **Severity** is the immediate operational pain if closed for 7 to 30 days.

* **Spillover** estimates second-order effects on prices, inventories, insurance, and production schedules across regions and sectors.

# **Map-Based Grouping for Operational Planning**

Think in corridors rather than points. On your internal map or dashboard, color these clusters as single operational systems:

1. **Red Sea System**: Bab el-Mandeb, Gulf of Aden, Suez Canal. Treat them as one, since risk at Bab el-Mandeb instantly propagates to Suez. 2024–2025 data shows traffic collapses and revenue shocks from Red Sea attacks, with knock-on diversions around the Cape \[1\]\[2\].

2. **Gulf Energy System**: Strait of Hormuz. Persistence of roughly one fifth of global petroleum liquids and about one third of seaborne crude through this gate concentrates energy shock risk \[3\]\[4\].

3. **Southeast Asia System**: Malacca primary, with Lombok and Sunda as relief. High volume and few cost-effective alternatives keep systemic risk elevated \[5\]\[6\]\[7\].

4. **Americas Inter-Oceanic System**: Panama Canal plus Cape Horn fallback. Hydrology, pricing, and policy are the key risk drivers. Even with improved water levels in 2025, throughput and cost controls remain management variables that can sap global schedule reliability \[8\]\[9\]\[10\].

5. **Black Sea System**: Turkish Straits. Maritime risk remains coupled to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and food-energy corridors \[11\].

# **Early-Warning Indicators to Watch**

* **Red Sea System**: Attack tempo near Bab el-Mandeb and strike radius into the Gulf of Aden. Lloyd’s Market Association bulletins, coalition maritime advisories, and Suez Authority daily stats \[1\]\[12\]\[13\]\[14\]\[15\]\[16\].

* **Hormuz**: Naval standoffs, mine and drone incidents, and sanction shifts that change tanker behavior. Monitor IEA and EIA flow updates \[3\]\[4\].

* **Malacca**: AIS congestion spikes in the Traffic Separation Scheme, piracy alerts, and weather disruptions. Watch regional port dwell times.

* **Panama**: Gatun Lake levels, lock allocation advisories, tariff changes, and draft restrictions. Even in a wet year, policy and pricing can cap effective capacity \[8\]\[9\]\[10\]\[18\]\[71\].

* **Turkish Straits**: Traffic control notices from Turkey, weather stoppages, and any Black Sea escalation affecting merchant vessel risk calculus.

# **Three Disruption Scenarios You Should Pre-Model**

1. **Dual-Corridor Shock**: Red Sea partial closure plus tariff-constrained Panama capacity. Expect global schedule reliability to fall and freight/insurance premia to rise simultaneously. Model container and refined products spreads under both shocks at once \[11\].

2. **Energy Shock at Hormuz**: Two-week forced slowdown. Blend EIA and IEA flow data to stress test Brent, LNG, and refined product pathways, and simulate release rates from strategic reserves \[3\]\[4\].

3. **Asia Manufacturing Shock**: Temporary restriction in Malacca with limited Lombok substitution. Quantify East Asia export lead time stretch and semiconductor and auto parts safety stock burn \[5\]\[6\]\[7\].

# **Hedging Moves for 2025 Planning**

* **Routing playbooks**: Pre-authorized Cape of Good Hope and Lombok diversions with decision triggers tied to AIS corridor risk and insurance thresholds.

* **Portfolio margins**: Increase floating safety stock for energy and critical components on lanes that depend on Red Sea and Malacca.

* **Contract optionality**: Negotiate variable routing and surcharge bands in carrier contracts to avoid ad hoc premiums during crises.

* **Data integration**: Fuse Suez and Panama daily statistics with port performance indices and insurance rates into your GSOC dashboard for rolling risk scores \[1\]\[2\]\[9\]\[10\]\[11\]\[16\].

* **Tabletop exercises**: Run 7, 14, and 30-day closure drills for the Red Sea System and Hormuz, including alternative bunkering plans and crew change policies.
