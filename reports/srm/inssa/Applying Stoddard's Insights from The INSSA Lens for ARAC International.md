# *Applying Stoddard's Insights from The INSSA Lens for ARAC International*

by M. Nuri Shakoor, INSSA Certified Security Risk Management Professional-C

Bringing it together for ARAC International & Lladner Business Solutions: Applying Stoddard's Insights to Our Practice as it relates to the core competencies of the International NGO Safety and Security Association


Learning from Stoddard doesn’t just give us “interesting theory” – it gives us very concrete upgrades to how we, as ARAC International and Lladner Business Solutions, *design and run* security risk management for the kinds of NGOs you support.

Below I’ll break it into:

* **A3 – Risk Identification** → how your risk analysis becomes sharper and more structured
* **B4 – Compliance, Performance & Effectiveness** → how your SRM *system* becomes fairer, more evidence-based, and more accountable

…and I’ll anchor this in **Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritania, Togo, Ghana, and Sierra Leone**, with practical scenarios.

---

## 1. Improving Practice under A3 – Risk Identification

From Stoddard: violence against aid and civil society workers is **not random**; it follows **identifiable patterns and incentives**. That insight is pure A3: we must identify risk in a structured way that reflects *who benefits* from targeting our partners and *what messages* those attacks send.

### A3.1 Actor- and incentive-based threat mapping (not just “generic insecurity”)

**What we learn from Stoddard**

* Threats are shaped by the **interests of state and non-state actors**, not just “bad security situations.”
* Many incidents are **political signalling**: punishing those seen as aligned with a rival power, donor, or political faction.
* Local staff, activists, and partners are often at **higher risk** than international or HQ actors.

**How ARAC & Lladner can apply this in West Africa**

Instead of listing only “theft, protest, harassment” as generic threats, your A3 practice should *always* ask:

> “Who might want to hurt or pressure this NGO/advocacy group, and *why* would it serve their interests?”

#### Scenario 1 – NGOs in Côte d’Ivoire (e.g., governance, land, or social cohesion programmes)

A national NGO in Abidjan and Bouaké supports community dialogue around land disputes and electoral tensions.

**Current (weak) A3-style risk identification might say:**

* Risk of:

  * Street crime
  * Protests and riots
  * Road accidents

**Improved Stoddard-informed A3 would also ask:**

* Which **youth groups or political movements** see this NGO as:

  * “On the side” of a rival party?
  * Threatening their control over local resources?
* Which **local authorities or business interests** resent monitoring of land deals?
* How might **security forces** react if protests break out during community meetings?

**Actionable A3 upgrades for ARAC/Lladner:**

* In every SRA, add a section:

  * *“Threat actors and interests”* (youth wings, chiefs, ex-combatants, political patrons, security forces).
* Run **actor-mapping workshops** with partner NGOs:

  * Map who controls which neighbourhoods, markets, and routes.
  * Identify who benefits if these NGOs are silenced or discredited.
* Integrate **political calendar analysis**:

  * Before elections, land reform announcements, or protests, explicitly reassess targeting risks.

---

#### Scenario 2 – Human rights advocates in Mauritania & Togo

These groups may work on issues such as slavery, police abuse, or restrictions on civic space.

**Key lesson from Stoddard:** the **state itself** can be a primary threat actor (arrests, raids, smear campaigns), and “neutrality” does not protect you when you challenge power.

**Improved A3 approach:**

* Identify **state-linked risks** explicitly:

  * Arbitrary arrest of staff
  * Seizure of devices and data
  * Administrative harassment (deregistering NGOs, tax inspections)
  * Online smear campaigns and doxxing
* Ask: **Which ministries, police units, or intelligence services are most likely to act?**

  * What triggers their action (public reports, media exposure, foreign funding, partnering with controversial intl NGOs)?

**Actionable A3 upgrades:**

* Add a **“state actor” threat column** in SRAs for HR groups:

  * Police
  * Interior/justice ministries
  * Intelligence services
* Include **legal & digital security threats** alongside physical threats:

  * Confiscation of laptops/phones
  * Hacking/ phishing of communications
  * Use of online surveillance tools
* With each partner:

  * Conduct a **“sensitivity review”** of their upcoming publications/advocacy: who might feel threatened, and what repertoire of response (legal, extra-legal) do they have?

---

#### Scenario 3 – Anti-corruption groups in Ghana & Sierra Leone

Groups exposing corruption in mining, procurement, or local government are especially exposed to **politically-protected business interests** and **criminal networks**.

**Stoddard’s key point:** many attacks reflect **economic incentives** – targeting those who interfere with lucrative schemes.

**Improved A3 approach:**

* Map **corruption value chains** as part of security analysis:

  * Who profits from illegal mining or inflated contracts?
  * Who controls illegal sites, logistics, protection?
  * Which officials supply protection or impunity?
* Identify the **most likely forms of retaliation**:

  * “Accidents,” threats to family, surveillance, bribery to internal “sources”, strategic lawsuits (SLAPPs).

**Actionable A3 upgrades:**

* For each investigation/advocacy campaign, ARAC/Lladner can facilitate a **“retaliation scenario workshop”**:

  * If we publish X, who loses money/status?
  * What have they done to others in similar situations?
* Integrate **family/household exposure** into the risk picture:

  * Home addresses, school routes, known social media profiles.
* Add **“economic interest score”** to risk ratings:

  * Higher when partners challenge high-value contracts, licences, or concessions.

---

### A3.2 Data-driven prioritisation & residual risk

Stoddard stresses using **incident data and trends** to prioritise threats and link them to **residual risk** and **program criticality**.

**How ARAC & Lladner can strengthen this:**

* Help partners in all five countries move from “we feel unsafe” to:

  * “Here are the *three top threats* by likelihood and impact, after mitigation.”

**Concrete A3 practices:**

* Build simple **incident/near-miss logs** with partners (even in Excel or Google Sheets).
* Quarterly, review:

  * Top 5 incident types
  * Where they occur (offices, travel, online)
  * Who is targeted (staff role, gender, public-facing vs back office)
* For each high-risk activity (field mission, publication, high-level meeting), require:

  * A short **residual risk statement** (“Even after measures A, B, C, there remains a high risk of X”).

Applied:

* **Côte d’Ivoire NGOs**: residual risk of youth-group hostility during meetings in politicised neighbourhoods.
* **Mauritania/Togo HR groups**: residual risk of arrest or raid after releasing a sensitive report.
* **Ghana/Sierra Leone anti-corruption**: residual risk of physical intimidation ahead of public hearings.

---

## 2. Improving Practice under B4 – Compliance, Performance & Effectiveness

Stoddard’s central critique is that the sector often **talks** about duty of care and SRM, but in reality:

* Risk is **transferred** to local staff and partners.
* SRM is treated as **bureaucracy**, not a professional, evidence-based function.

B4 is where ARAC and Lladner can help your clients build **stronger, fairer, more accountable SRM systems**.

### B4.1 Equalising duty of care & avoiding risk transfer

**Stoddard’s warning:** international organisations often operate with good SOPs and resources for internationals, while **national staff and partners absorb the highest risk** with less protection and support.

For your context, this is huge:

* Local NGOs in Côte d’Ivoire working under the brand of INGOs.
* Grassroots HR activists in Mauritania/Togo who carry the legal and social risk.
* Anti-corruption partners in Ghana/Sierra Leone who are “the face” of advocacy, while donors remain in the background.

**System-level B4 improvements ARAC/Lladner can drive:**

* When designing SRM frameworks or security plans for NGOs:

  * Require that **national staff and partners have access to the same core protections**, e.g.:

    * Security briefings & training
    * Safe transport policy, including after-hours
    * Legal support/contacts
    * Psychosocial support after incidents
* Build **duty of care clauses into partnership agreements**:

  * Minimum SRM standards (communication, safe meeting spaces, safe data handling)
  * Joint contingency planning (who does what in case of arrest, threat, or attack)
  * Clear statement that partners can *pause activities* if risk exceeds agreed thresholds, without financial penalties.

**Example – Anti-corruption coalition in Sierra Leone:**

* Instead of:

  * INGO has a security plan; local group is expected to “manage as they can.”
* B4-compliant system:

  * Shared security SOPs for field visits to mining areas.
  * Joint security induction and negotiation training.
  * Shared emergency fund for relocation/temporary safe housing after threats.

### B4.2 Measuring SRM effectiveness, not just “having documents”

Stoddard argues that real professionalism means asking: *“Is our SRM system actually protecting people while allowing us to operate?”*

**For ARAC & Lladner, that means building performance metrics into your support:**

* Move beyond:

  * “We have an SRA”
  * “We have a security policy”
* Towards:

  * “We can show our SRM has reduced incidents and improved access – or we know where it hasn’t, and we’re fixing it.”

**Practical B4 measures you can implement for partners:**

For NGOs in Côte d’Ivoire, HR groups in Mauritania/Togo, and anti-corruption groups in Ghana/Sierra Leone, support them to track:

* **Compliance metrics** (are people following the system?):

  * % of field trips preceded by a documented risk review and movement plan.
  * % of critical events (protests, public launches, high-risk meetings) with a written security plan.
* **Effectiveness metrics**:

  * Number of incidents/near misses per quarter per type of activity.
  * Repetition of similar incidents (showing lessons were *not* learned).
  * Days of safe presence in sensitive communities vs. incident trends.

**Example – Human rights advocates in Togo:**

* Before:

  * No systematic log of threats; decisions driven by fear or bravado.
* After B4-style improvements:

  * Threats, smear campaigns, and police harassment logged and analysed.
  * Advocacy events rescheduled or redesigned based on patterns (e.g., shifting from large public rallies to smaller, closed-door stakeholder meetings when online hate campaigns spike).
  * Annual review: which measures correlated with fewer arrests/harassment?

---

### B4.3 Building a culture of professional SRM (not heroic improvisation)

Stoddard’s “professional humanitarianism” idea calls for **structured, trained, accountable SRM**, not just “brave staff taking risks”.

For ARAC and Lladner, that means:

* Positioning SRM as a **governance and leadership issue**, not just a technical/security issue.

**Concrete B4 actions across your clients:**

* **Leadership engagement:**

  * Facilitate sessions where NGO boards and directors in all five countries formally review:

    * Top strategic risks identified (from A3)
    * Residual risks that were accepted
    * Incidents and lessons learned
  * Require leadership sign-off on **risk acceptance** decisions (e.g., proceeding with a high-risk corruption report).
* **Structured learning cycles:**

  * After every serious incident or near miss:

    * Run a short, non-blaming **after-action review**.
    * Capture “what we’ll do differently next time” in updated SOPs and training.
* **Competency-based development:**

  * Build SRM competencies (aligned with INSSA) into staff JD and performance reviews:

    * For field coordinators in Côte d’Ivoire
    * For HR programme managers in Mauritania/Togo
    * For anti-corruption leads in Ghana/Sierra Leone
  * Use Stoddard’s book as part of **CPD reading** to back up why the organisation is moving to a more structured, less ad hoc approach.

## Bringing it together for ARAC International & Lladner Business Solutions: 

If you translate Stoddard’s insights into INSSA language and your West Africa portfolio, the upgrades look like this:

* **Under A3**, your support to NGOs and advocacy groups becomes:

  * More **actor- and incentive-focused** (who benefits from targeting them, and how).
  * More **data-driven** (incident logs, trends, residual risk).
  * More **politically aware** (state actors as threats, economic interests, electoral timelines).

* **Under B4**, your SRM systems and consultancy products:

  * Reduce **risk transfer** to local partners and national staff by equalising duty of care.
  * Include **monitoring and learning loops**, not just policy-writing.
  * Make SRM a **leadership responsibility** with clear indicators and accountability.

If you’d like, next step we can design a **simple INSSA-aligned A3/B4 checklist** specifically tailored for:

* NGOs in Côte d’Ivoire
* HR advocates in Mauritania & Togo
* Anti-corruption actors in Ghana & Sierra Leone

…that you can use as a standard tool across ARAC and Lladner engagements.



The core argument of ***Necessary Risks*** lines up very neatly with INSSA’s idea of a *professional*, systematised approach to SRM—especially in **A3: Risk Identification** and **B4: Compliance, Performance and Effectiveness**. Below I’ll walk through the correlations and then turn them into concrete action points you can use as an SRMP-C or SRMP-R.

---

## 1. A3 – Risk Identification

**INSSA definition:** A3 is about *systematically identifying security threats, hazards and vulnerabilities* as the foundation for analysis, evaluation and treatment. ([Ready][1])

Stoddard’s whole book is essentially a masterclass in A3 applied to humanitarian operations:

* She shows that major attacks on aid workers are **not random**, but clustered in a few high-risk countries and driven by identifiable political and criminal incentives. 
* She unpacks **who** is attacking (e.g., insurgent groups vs. global jihadist movements vs. bandits), **where and how** (roads, compounds, kidnappings, complex attacks) and **against whom** (national vs international staff). 
* She emphasises that effective SRM starts with **threat assessment, actor mapping, and scoring risks by probability and impact**, not with vague fear or media narratives. 

All of that is exactly what INSSA expects from A3: moving from intuition alone to structured, evidence-based risk identification.

### How the book strengthens A3 in practice

**a. Multi-level threat identification**

Stoddard pushes us to identify risk at three levels: environments, actors, and institutions. 

**Action points for A3:**

* **Map threats by level:**

  * *Environment*: type of conflict (asymmetric, non-international), level of state fragility, impunity.
  * *Actors*: local militias, global jihadist groups, criminal gangs, community mobs, state forces.
  * *Institution*: your organization’s footprint, branding, partner structure, association with UN/military/Western donors.
* **Explicitly add “ethical risk” and “partner risk”** to your risk register (e.g., transferring risk to local NGOs, unequal duty of care) instead of focusing only on physical and fiduciary risks. 

---

**b. Data- and evidence-based identification**

The book leans heavily on the **Aid Worker Security Database** and incident data to show patterns over time and across contexts.   This reinforces INSSA’s expectation that A3 is not a one-off “brainstorm” but an ongoing, data-driven process.

**Action points for A3:**

* **Triangulate multiple data sources** when identifying risk:

  * Global/sectoral data (e.g., AWSD, OCHA, GISF/HPN studies).
  * Your own incident & near-miss database.
  * Partner and community reports, including informal channels.
* **Break incident data down** by:

  * Tactic/context (road movements, compounds, crowd events, checkpoints, kidnappings, cyber/INFOSEC, etc.).
  * Perpetrator type (non-state armed group, state security forces, criminal gangs, mobs).
  * Staff profile (national vs international, partner staff, volunteers, contractors).
* Use those patterns to **prioritise “top 5” lethal or high-impact threat types** per country/sub-office, and feed that into your SRAs and contingency plans.

---

**c. Threat/actor mapping and acceptance**

Stoddard reconnects SRM with classic humanitarian tools like the **security triangle** (acceptance, protection, deterrence) and stresses that acceptance is not simply “no guns” but **active, continuous engagement** with communities and armed actors.

**Action points for A3:**

* For each area of operation, **map threat actors and their incentives**:

  * What do they gain from tolerating you? From targeting you?
  * How do they perceive your organization (UN proxy, Western actor, local ally, economic resource)?
* Identify **concrete, visible elements of your presence** that matter to those actors (e.g., “no guns” policy, free care for all, no cash at checkpoints) and incorporate them into acceptance strategies from the risk identification stage. 
* Include **acceptance indicators** in your identification process: level of community trust, rumours, community leaders’ stance, past negotiation outcomes.

---

**d. Residual risk and program criticality**

The book ties risk identification to **residual risk** (what remains after mitigation) and **program criticality** (how vital the programme is to affected people).

**Action points for A3:**

* When you identify threats, **always carry them through to residual risk**:

  * Document: “Even after measures X, Y, Z, we still face the threat of ___ with probability __ and impact __.”
* Make program criticality an explicit column in your risk register:

  * Life-saving vs life-sustaining vs non-critical.
  * Use it to inform which high risks you are willing to *accept* vs *not accept*.

---

## 2. B4 – Compliance, Performance and Effectiveness

**INSSA definition:** B4 is about ensuring **compliance with SRM policies and standards, and monitoring the performance and effectiveness** of the SRM system itself. ([Ready][1])

Stoddard’s “professional humanitarianism” argument is essentially a B4 argument: a mature sector needs systems that are **not just written**, but actually **used, monitored, and improved**.

### How the book strengthens B4 in practice

**a. Professionalism vs “bureaucratic security”**

She rebuts the claim that professionalized SRM “kills the chivalrous spirit” of humanitarianism, arguing that good systems **augment**, not replace, judgment and field experience.

**Action points for B4:**

* **Audit how SRM tools are perceived and actually used**:

  * Are SRAs, checklists, and SOPs seen as “tick boxes,” or as genuine decision aids?
  * Conduct short, structured staff feedback sessions after critical missions: “Which SRM tools actually helped you? Which got in the way?”
* Build compliance metrics that track **meaningful use**, not just “document exists”:

  * % of field trips with completed movement plans AND debriefs.
  * % of incidents where SOPs were followed, and if not, why.

---

**b. Duty of care & equalisation of risk**

The book exposes serious **gaps in duty of care**, especially between expats and national staff and between INGOs and local partners, and argues that risk is often **transferred** rather than shared.

This speaks directly to B4’s “effectiveness” dimension: an SRM system is not effective if it protects HQ and expats while leaving national staff and partners exposed.

**Action points for B4:**

* Build **equity checks** into your SRM performance reviews:

  * Compare security inputs (training, comms, transport, safe housing, evacuation options) for national staff vs internationals.
  * Review partner agreements to see whether they include minimum SRM standards, training, and shared contingency planning.
* Add **duty of care indicators**:

  * % of national staff that received the same pre-deployment training package as internationals.
  * % of partners with documented SRM measures and joint incident response protocols.
* Treat “risk transfer to partners” as a **red-flag noncompliance** item in your audits, not as a normal business practice. 

---

**c. Measuring SRM effectiveness, not just having a system**

Stoddard stresses that having a “system” or “manual” is not the goal; the question is whether it **enables presence and access while keeping staff safe**. She cites evidence that risk management systems, where applied, have *not* been shown to reduce operational presence, and highlights cases where weak or vague analyses drove risk-averse decisions.

**Action points for B4:**

* Define **SRM performance indicators** tied to operational outcomes, such as:

  * Days of presence/access in high-risk areas vs incident rates.
  * Number of near misses and lessons captured vs repeated patterns.
  * Time from incident to corrective action implemented.
* Turn every major incident or near miss into a **mini SRM effectiveness review**:

  * Were threats correctly identified in the SRA?
  * Were mitigating measures actually implemented?
  * Did non-compliance or design flaws drive the incident?
* Present SRM performance dashboards to **senior management and boards**, not just security teams, so that compliance and effectiveness become governance issues, not technical footnotes.

---

**d. Continuous learning and a competence-based model**

The book explicitly advocates a shift from “good intentions and ad hoc practice” to a **competence-based model** grounded in evidence and standards—the same logic as the SRMP/INSSA framework itself.

**Action points for B4:**

* Link **CPD plans** for SRM staff directly to competencies like A3 and B4:

  * Choose trainings, readings (like *Necessary Risks*), and simulations that explicitly build those competency areas.
* Incorporate **lessons learned** from incidents into:

  * Annual policy reviews.
  * Updated SOPs and SRAs.
  * Future training scenarios.
* Make **SRM professionalism** part of performance management:

  * Include adherence to SRM practice (not just zero incidents) in manager evaluations.
  * Reward behaviours like transparent incident reporting, critical reflection, and proactive improvement of procedures.

---

### Bringing it together

In short:

* **A3 (Risk Identification)**: *Necessary Risks* reinforces that high-quality risk identification is empirical, multi-layered (environment–actor–institution), and tied to program criticality and residual risk—not just a feeling that “it’s getting dangerous.”
* **B4 (Compliance, Performance and Effectiveness)**: The book argues for treating SRM as a core professional function, monitored for how well it *enables presence with protection* and how fairly it spreads risk and duty of care across staff and partners.

If you’re preparing for or maintaining SRMP certification, using this book as a CPD resource makes a lot of sense: you can explicitly document how your learning from it has improved your practice under **A3** (better, more structured risk identification) and **B4** (stronger, fairer, more evidence-based SRM systems).

“**Necessary Risks: Professional Humanitarianism and Violence against Aid Workers**” by Abby Stoddard is a data-driven, critical examination of why aid workers are attacked in modern conflicts, what that means for affected populations, and how the humanitarian sector should respond. Drawing on over 15 years of research and the Aid Worker Security Database, Stoddard shows that major attacks against aid workers have risen significantly since the late 1990s, but are heavily concentrated in a small number of extremely violent contexts such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, South Sudan and DRC.

The book argues that attacks on aid workers are *not* random or purely incidental; they are shaped by political and military incentives. Non-state armed groups often see aid organizations as proxy targets for the state or the wider Western-led international order, using violence against them to undermine that order or gain leverage.  At the same time, these attacks are symptoms of wider state fragility and weak governance, making them a useful indicator of a downward spiral in state stability.

Stoddard situates this violence within three main dimensions:

* **Environments:** Today’s wars are largely non-international, asymmetric conflicts fought in weakly governed or failing states. Traditional legal protections for “neutral” humanitarians fit poorly with these settings, where warring parties may not recognize the laws of war or the special status of aid agencies.
* **Individuals and armed actors:** The book explores how insurgent groups calculate the benefits of targeting aid providers (for ransom, propaganda, territorial control, or punishment) and how their decisions are shaped by proximity, opportunity, and perceived alignment of aid agencies with their enemies.
* **Institutions:** It examines how the rapid growth of the humanitarian sector—larger budgets, more operations in high-risk areas, complex partnerships—has created both more exposure and an “identity crisis” around balancing duty of care with the ethical obligation to reach the most vulnerable.

The early chapters quantify the problem—tracking trends in killings, kidnappings, and attacks by weapon type, organization type, staff profile (showing that the vast majority of victims are national staff), and by country. Stoddard stresses that global statistics are useful for understanding patterns and resource allocation, but operational decision-making depends on context-specific, field-level incident and threat data.

Subsequent chapters move through:

* The erosion and politicization of humanitarian “neutrality” in modern wars, including how association with Western governments, UN missions, or counter-terrorism agendas undermines perceptions of impartiality.
* The logic of non-state armed actors’ engagement with aid agencies, and the practical craft of humanitarian negotiation—arguing that effective access negotiations rely less on lecturing parties about humanitarian principles and more on understanding their interests, values, and incentives.
* The failures of host states: from incapacity to protect, to direct complicity in attacks, to moments of “peak volatility” when conflict dynamics shift suddenly and risk spikes (for example, the Terrain Hotel attack in Juba).
* Organizational impediments: fragmented risk management, unequal duty of care for national vs international staff, donor pressures around “access,” and the tendency to transfer instead of share risk with local partners.

In the final chapter, Stoddard rejects a false binary between “passionate” humanitarian idealism and “bureaucratic” risk management. She calls instead for a **reframed ethos of professional humanitarianism**: evidence-based, ethically grounded, and focused on the best outcomes for affected populations, not on the personal heroism of aid workers or the institutional interests of their organizations.  This professional approach includes rigorous risk assessment, dedicated security expertise, negotiation capacity with armed actors, and explicit acceptance of residual risk *only* when program criticality justifies it.

Overall, *Necessary Risks* is both diagnosis and prescription: it explains why violence against aid workers has become a persistent feature of contemporary conflict, and argues that the sector’s path forward lies in mature, professional security risk management that equalizes duty of care for national and international staff, treats local partners as co-owners of risk, and keeps the needs and rights of crisis-affected populations at the center.
