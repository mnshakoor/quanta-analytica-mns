### **1.0 Introduction: The Strategic Imperative for Partnership-Centric Security**

This strategic plan mandates our organization’s deliberate transformation from a traditional, compliance-based Security Risk Management (SRM) model to a more equitable, effective, and partnership-centric approach. This is not an incremental adjustment; it is a fundamental shift in our security culture, policy, and practice. Our evolution is guided by the principles articulated in the Global Interagency Security Forum (GISF) *Partnerships and Security Risk Management: a joint action guide* \[1\], with the explicit goal of achieving robust alignment with Competency Area B (Principles, Policies and Protocols) of the International NGO Safety and Security Association (INSSA) standards. This document provides senior management and security focal points with a clear roadmap for driving these systemic changes. It outlines a comprehensive approach embedded across four interdependent strategic pillars, designed to transform how we manage risk *with* our partners, moving decisively from risk transfer to a model of genuine risk sharing.

### **2.0 Foundational Principles: Shifting from Risk Transfer to Risk Sharing**

Effective SRM in partnership settings cannot be built on compliance checklists and top-down assessments of partner capacity. It requires a foundation of trust, equity, and mutual respect \[1\]. To build this foundation, we must adopt a new philosophy that changes the very nature of our security dialogue with partners. This section synthesizes four core principles from the GISF guide that will shift our entire approach—from risk transfer to genuine risk sharing, and from unilateral evaluation to joint problem-solving.

* **Equitable Partnerships:** We commit to valuing our partners' contextual knowledge and contributions as equal to our own. This principle ensures their security concerns are heard, understood, and addressed with the same priority as ours, recognizing that both partners have equal rights to be respected despite potential power imbalances \[1\].  
* **Joint Accountability:** We will move decisively away from "top-down assessments" toward a model where duty of care is a shared, two-way obligation. Accountability will become a mutual mechanism, empowering both organizations to report concerns and hold each other responsible for meeting agreed-upon SRM commitments \[1\].  
* **Risk Sharing, Not Transfer:** We strategically commit to openly discussing, analyzing, and jointly managing security risks. This principle prohibits the intentional or unintentional transfer of disproportionate risk to our local and national partners and shifts the focus from the challenges of ‘risk transfer’ to the opportunities of genuine ‘risk sharing’ \[1\].  
* **Contextualized and Co-Created Standards:** We will develop and adapt SRM policies and procedures *with* our partners. This ensures they are appropriate for the local context, accessible to all staff in relevant languages, and operationally relevant, rather than being standards exported from a global headquarters \[1\].

These foundational principles provide the 'why' behind our strategic transformation. The following pillars detail the 'how' we will bring them to life through concrete, systemic action.

### **3.0 Strategic Pillar 1: Re-engineering Policy and Standards (INSSA B1 Alignment)**

Organizational SRM policy is the ultimate source of authority for all security practices. To operationalize our commitment to **Equitable Partnerships** and **Contextualized Standards**, our policies must be explicitly re-engineered to reflect the realities of collaboration. A policy that does not acknowledge partnership dynamics cannot effectively guide joint action \[1\]. This pillar establishes the mandate for that change.

#### **3.1. Strategic Objective**

To redesign and develop security policies and standards that are coherent, contextualized, rights-respecting, and explicitly integrate a partnership-based SRM approach as a core organizational mandate \[1\].

#### **3.2. Key Strategic Actions**

1. **Integrate a Partnership SRM Mandate into Core Policy:** Revise the global security policy to include a dedicated "Partnership SRM" section. This section will mandate the comparison of partner mandates, values, and risk thresholds during partner selection. It will also require that all partnership agreements include a statement affirming that the agreement does not contradict either partner’s core SRM policy and establishes a joint risk-threshold for the specific engagement \[1\].  
2. **Institutionalize Joint Policy Reviews:** Mandate the use of the GISF *Joint SRM Review Questionnaire (Tool 3\)* as a standard checklist during all partnership inception phases. This tool will institutionalize the process of ensuring policy alignment and proactively identifying areas requiring revision or joint clarification \[1\].  
3. **Embed Equity in Policy Language:** Require the explicit incorporation of "equitable risk-sharing" and anti-bias language into the SRM policy. This action must address and prohibit unequal security standards across different staff groups within a partnership context \[1\].  
4. **Mandate Policy Adaptation and Translation:** Establish a formal requirement that all SRM policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) affecting partners must be translated and adapted *with direct partner input* before joint implementation \[1\].

Establishing a robust policy framework is the first step. The next is to build the critical structures of accountability needed to enforce it.

### **4.0 Strategic Pillar 2: Defining Joint Accountability and Responsibility (INSSA B2 Alignment)**

To operationalize the principles of **Joint Accountability** and **Equitable Partnerships**, we must move from abstract commitments to concrete practice. This requires explicitly defining and documenting roles, responsibilities, and governance mechanisms for SRM within every partnership. Without clear accountability structures, the principles of risk sharing and mutual duty of care remain aspirational rather than operational \[1\].

#### **4.1. Strategic Objective**

To establish and document clear, shared SRM roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for every partnership, ensuring duty of care is treated as a joint obligation and accountability is mutual, transparent, and enforceable \[1\].

#### **4.2. Key Strategic Actions**

1. **Standardize SRM Governance in Partnership Agreements:** Require every new and renewed partnership agreement to include two standard components: a formal **SRM Accountability Statement** and a simple **SRM Governance Diagram** clearly illustrating named focal points, key decision-makers, and agreed escalation paths for security issues \[1\].  
2. **Integrate Mutual Duty of Care Assessments:** Revise all partner due-diligence and assessment tools to incorporate GISF's duty of care questions and indicators. This change will ensure *both* partners' obligations are documented and monitored, shifting from a one-way audit to a mutual understanding \[1\].  
3. **Establish a Joint Concern-Reporting Mechanism:** Mandate the creation of a joint, confidential procedure for reporting and escalating SRM-related concerns within each partnership. This creates a formal, safe channel for addressing issues such as non-adherence to agreed measures or unsafe practices \[1\].  
4. **Embed SRM Responsibilities in Human Resources Systems:** Direct Human Resources to work with the Security Unit to ensure that SRM responsibilities identified in joint reviews are explicitly integrated into relevant job descriptions and performance management systems, as suggested by GISF \[1\].

With clear accountability structures in place, we must ensure these commitments are properly resourced through integrated planning and budgeting.

### **5.0 Strategic Pillar 3: Integrating SRM into Planning and Budgeting (INSSA B3 Alignment)**

To make our commitment to **Risk Sharing, Not Transfer** a reality, we must transform SRM from a reactive, often unfunded mandate into a core, fully resourced component of all partnership-based programming. Proactive, joint planning and budgeting are essential. Security costs must be considered at the earliest opportunity in the project lifecycle to ensure all partners have the funding needed to work safely and effectively \[1\].

#### **5.1. Strategic Objective**

To systemically integrate joint SRM planning and costing into all phases of the project cycle, ensuring all identified security requirements are properly and equitably resourced for all partners involved in program delivery \[1\].

#### **5.2. Key Strategic Actions**

1. **Mandate Joint Risk Assessment and Costing:** Establish the use of GISF's *Joint Security Risk Assessment and Management Plan (Tool 5\)* and *Security Risk Management in Partnerships Budget Template (Tool 6\)* as a minimum requirement for all medium and high-risk partnerships. SRM plans emerging from this process *must* be fully costed in project proposals \[1\].  
2. **Introduce SRM Budget Checkpoints in the Project Cycle:** Update the organization's Project Cycle Management SOPs to include a mandatory SRM checkpoint at the proposal design stage. This step must verify that security budget lines are present and sufficient for both partners (covering training, equipment, staff welfare) and require written justification if such costs are minimal or absent \[1\].  
3. **Formalize SRM Funding Discussions in Partnership Management:** Make SRM funding a standing, required agenda item for all partnership inception and regular review meetings. These discussions must address three critical questions guided by GISF: Who controls the security budget? Are the resources sufficient for the identified risks? And how flexible is the funding to adapt to changing conditions? \[1\].  
4. **Develop Staff Capacity in Risk-Based Budgeting:** Initiate a targeted training program for all programme, grants, and finance staff on how to link security risk assessments directly to defensible SRM budgets, using GISF's guidance and tools as the standard \[1\].

Moving from the crucial stage of planning and budgeting, we must turn to the essential process of monitoring implementation and effectiveness.

### **6.0 Strategic Pillar 4: Institutionalizing Joint Compliance and Learning (INSSA B4 Alignment)**

A plan without verification is merely an aspiration. This pillar transforms our approach to compliance from a top-down audit into a mechanism for mutual assurance. We will institutionalize a joint, transparent process to verify that *both* partners are meeting their agreed SRM responsibilities, shifting our focus from unilateral enforcement to shared learning and continuous improvement \[1\]. This pillar brings the principle of **Joint Accountability** to its full operational conclusion.

#### **6.1. Strategic Objective**

To implement a systematic, joint framework for monitoring SRM compliance, analyzing performance, and fostering a shared culture of learning and continuous improvement within and across partnerships \[1\].

#### **6.2. Key Strategic Actions**

1. **Establish a Joint SRM Review Calendar:** Mandate the creation of a joint SRM compliance and review calendar for each long-term partnership. Reviews must be triggered by a set timeframe (e.g., every two years) or by significant contextual changes, in line with GISF recommendations \[1\].  
2. **Develop Standardized Joint Monitoring Tools:** Task the global security unit with creating and disseminating two standard tools based on GISF's compliance and effectiveness indicators: a simple **SRM Compliance Checklist** for partnership reviews and a shared **Post-Incident Learning Template** to facilitate joint analysis \[1\].  
3. **Formalize Compliance Responsibilities in Job Descriptions:** Ensure that SRM compliance monitoring responsibilities are formally embedded into the job descriptions and annual appraisal forms of all named SRM focal points and key country-level managers, thereby reinforcing accountability \[1\].  
4. **Integrate SRM Capacity into Performance Frameworks:** Require that all partnership monitoring frameworks include specific, measurable performance indicators for SRM capacity-strengthening (e.g., number of partner staff trained, documented use of joint tools, improved incident reporting rates). These indicators must be reviewed via the joint SRM action plan \[1\].

Together, these four pillars represent a comprehensive system for transforming our security culture and practice.

### **7.0 Conclusion: A Vision for Safer, More Equitable Partnerships**

This strategic plan charts a course for a fundamental shift in our approach to security—from a unilateral, risk-averse function to a core enabler of effective and equitable partnership. It moves our practice from asking "are our partners compliant?" to "are we managing risk together effectively?".

The four pillars—Policy, Accountability, Planning, and Compliance—work in concert to create a holistic system that enhances our duty of care for all staff, respects the expertise of our partners, and strengthens the resilience and impact of our joint programming. By rigorously implementing this plan, we will not only fulfill our duty of care more effectively but also build the resilient, trust-based partnerships necessary to deliver greater humanitarian impact in the world's most challenging environments. This is how we become a leader in the sector.
