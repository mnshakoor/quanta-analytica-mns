    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page dashboard with tabbed navigation. This design was chosen over a linear report to serve the target audience (analysts, strategists) who require non-linear access to information. Users can instantly switch between PESTELS categories (e.g., from 'Economic' indicators to 'Security' threats) to facilitate cross-domain analysis and synthesis. Each section begins with high-level summary cards for quick insights, followed by detailed text and interactive visualizations for deeper exploration. This structure prioritizes user efficiency and data discovery. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application uses a combination of data cards, textual summaries, and interactive charts to present the complex information. Report Info: GDP Composition -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Hover for details -> Justification: Clearly shows sector contributions. Library: Chart.js. Report Info: Population Structure -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Bar Chart (Population Pyramid) -> Interaction: Hover for age/gender breakdown -> Justification: Standard, intuitive way to show demographics. Library: Chart.js. Report Info: Human Rights Issues -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: Interactive Text Blocks -> Interaction: Click to reveal details -> Justification: Manages information density and allows user-driven exploration of sensitive topics. Method: Vanilla JS. This approach ensures all information is presented in its most effective and digestible format. -->

<center><strong>Bertelsmann Transformation Index Political Report – Mauritania (BTI Report, 2024)</strong></center>
<br>
  <strong>Government Structure & Leadership</strong>
  <p>
    Mauritania is officially an Islamic Republic operating under a presidential system, but its political landscape remains heavily shaped by the military elite. Despite formal democratic procedures and periodic elections, real political power continues to be concentrated in the hands of the executive and security apparatus. The current leadership, under President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, maintains relative popular legitimacy but also benefits from a security-first governance model rooted in military patronage.
  </p><br>

  <strong>Political Stability & Institutional Control</strong>
  <p>
    According to the Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI) 2024, Mauritania scores <strong>8/10</strong> on the indicator <em>"Monopoly on the Use of Force"</em>, suggesting a <strong>high degree of political stability</strong> in terms of state authority and territorial integrity. The government faces no active insurgencies or separatist movements, and national security forces maintain consistent control over the country’s borders and internal regions.
    However, political stability is not synonymous with democratic resilience. The dominance of the security sector in civil governance undermines institutional checks and balances. While major violent conflict is absent, power remains personalized, and avenues for peaceful political contestation are limited.
  </p><br>

  <strong>Democratic Institutions, Human Rights & Governance Risks</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><Elections are held regularly, but opposition parties operate under constraints, and political pluralism remains limited.</li>
    <li>The judiciary lacks independence, and public trust in formal political institutions is low.</li>
    <li>The military wields informal veto power over key policy areas, restricting genuine civilian oversight.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br>
    According to BTI 2024, the democratic quality of institutions is <strong>weak</strong>, with <strong>limited accountability</strong>, <strong>concentrated executive power</strong>, and a <strong>fragile rule-of-law environment</strong>. These dynamics present <strong>medium-to-high governance risk</strong> for long-term investors and diplomatic partners.
Also, the U.S. State Department’s 2024 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, Mauritania remains on Tier 2. The government is making efforts to combat trafficking and hereditary slavery, but challenges persist:

Hereditary slavery practices still affect vulnerable communities, particularly the Haratine and Afro-Mauritanian populations <i>(most recently verified with international diaspora communities during UNGA80)</i>.

Some law enforcement and judicial officials refuse to investigate slavery-related crimes, and cases are often settled informally, outside formal courts.

Victims of sex trafficking and hereditary slavery are at times prosecuted for fornication or adultery, reflecting weak victim protections.

The government has made progress by prosecuting traffickers and creating victims’ funds, but enforcement remains inconsistent and under-resourced.
  </p><br>

  <strong>Regional Context & Geopolitical Exposure</strong>
  <p>
    Mauritania's geographic proximity to the Sahel conflict zone (notably Mali) poses potential spillover risks. Although it has successfully avoided the kind of instability that has plagued neighbors, persistent insecurity in the region demands continued vigilance. Border control and counterterrorism efforts receive significant external support (e.g., from France and the G5 Sahel), but long-term sustainability depends on institutional reform.
  </p><br>

  <strong>Key Political Risk Factors:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Military-dominated governance structure</li>
    <li>2. Lack of robust democratic checks and balances</li>
    <li>3. Potential for external shock spillover from Sahel conflicts</li>
    <li>4. Ethnic tensions and social exclusion risks, especially among Haratin and Black African communities</li>
  </ul><br>

  <strong>Summary Assessment:</strong>
  <p>
    Mauritania exhibits <strong>high coercive stability</strong> but remains vulnerable in terms of <strong>democratic legitimacy and governance transparency</strong>. The political environment is stable in the short term but requires structural reform to ensure resilience and inclusivity over the long term.

                        <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> The country is experiencing rising temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall. The Sahara Desert is expanding southward, encroaching on arable and grazing land.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Scarcity:</strong> As a largely desert nation, Mauritania has extremely limited freshwater resources. Over-exploitation of aquifers and drought are worsening the situation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Food Security:</strong> Climate change directly impacts agriculture and pastoralism, the mainstays for much of the rural population. This leads to chronic food insecurity, with many reliant on international aid (Source: ReliefWeb).</li>
                        <li><strong>Responses:</strong> The government, with support from partners like the World Bank, has initiated projects like the Great Green Wall to combat desertification and programs to improve water management, but the scale of the challenge is immense.</li>

                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-600">The legal system is a hybrid of Islamic law (Shari'a) and French civil law. While modern statutes address issues like slavery and human rights, their implementation and enforcement remain weak, creating a significant gap between law and practice.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Legal System:</strong> Courts apply both Shari'a law, particularly in family and personal status matters, and secular codes inherited from the French colonial period.</li>
                        <li><strong>Anti-Slavery Legislation:</strong> Mauritania criminalized slavery in 2007 and passed a stronger law in 2015 making it a crime against humanity. However, prosecutions are rare and ineffective, and activists who report cases often face persecution (Source: HRW, Amnesty).</li>
                        <li><strong>Civil Liberties:</strong> The constitution provides for freedoms of speech and press, but these rights are severely restricted in practice. Laws criminalizing "blasphemy" and "insulting the state" are used to suppress dissent.</li>
                        <li><strong>U.S. TPS Act of 2024 (H.R.7034):</strong> This proposed legislation in the U.S. Congress would grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Mauritanian nationals. Its introduction signifies U.S. legislative concern over the "exceptional and extraordinary conditions" in Mauritania, citing entrenched hereditary slavery, racial discrimination, and state-sanctioned violence that prevent safe return.</li>

                        <li><strong>Counter-Terrorism:</strong> The Mauritanian military is considered one of the more effective forces in the region and has successfully prevented major terrorist attacks on its soil for over a decade. It is a key member of the G5 Sahel joint force.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Security:</strong> While politically motivated violence is low, high unemployment and social tensions create risks of civil unrest. Common crime, such as theft and robbery, is a concern in urban centers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Border Security:</strong> Securing the long, remote borders in the Sahara is a major challenge and a priority for the government and its international partners.</li>
