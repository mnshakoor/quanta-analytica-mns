# **A Systems-Thinking Framework for Sustainable Peace and Conflict Prevention: A Strategic Brief for Policymakers**

## **1.0 The Deteriorating Global Security Landscape: An Urgent Call for a New Approach**

The international security environment is increasingly volatile, complex, and contested. Long-standing alliances are shifting, geopolitical rivalries are intensifying, and the nature of conflict itself is becoming more fragmented and intractable. In this turbulent landscape, traditional, reactive approaches to conflict management, intervening only after violence has erupted, are proving profoundly insufficient. The immense human and economic costs of this instability create an urgent imperative for a new strategic framework: one that is proactive, holistic, and focused on building the systemic resilience that underpins sustainable peace.

Recent global analyses paint a stark picture of declining peacefulness. The confluence of rising military expenditure and heightened geopolitical friction underscores the fragility of the current international system. Key indicators reveal a world moving decisively in the wrong direction:

* The 2025 Global Peace Index (GPI) found that the world became less peaceful for the 13th time in the last 17 years, with peacefulness deteriorating in 87 countries.  \[1\]

* The GPI's Ongoing Conflict domain registered the largest deterioration, signaling a global intensification of violence.  \[1\]

* Geopolitical risk has risen to levels exceeding those of the Cold War, approaching the peaks observed in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.

* Global military expenditure reached a record **$2.43 trillion** in 2023, the largest single-year increase since 2009, driven largely by ongoing major conflicts.  \[2\]

This surge in violence carries severe and escalating economic consequences. In 2024, the global economic impact of violence reached **$19.97 trillion**. \[1\] As the following table illustrates, the costs directly associated with conflict have skyrocketed over the past 16 years, while investment in the foundations of peace has sharply declined.

**Table 1: Growth in Economic Impact of Violence (2008-2024)**

| Category | Percentage Change |
| ----- | ----- |
| Conflict deaths | \+421% |
| GDP losses from conflict | \+412% |
| Refugees and IDPs | \+212% |
| Peacebuilding | \-31% |

This $19.97 trillion burden, driven overwhelmingly by reactive measures, makes a compelling fiscal and moral case for a strategic pivot: from managing violence to proactively dismantling its root causes.

## **2.0 Analyzing the Root Causes: Why Contemporary Conflicts Emerge and Escalate**

To move beyond perpetual crisis management, it is strategically essential to diagnose the root causes of conflict rather than merely treating its symptoms. Contemporary violent conflicts are rarely spontaneous eruptions; they are typically the culmination of long-simmering, group-based grievances rooted in exclusion, inequality, and systemic institutional failures.

A landmark study on conflict prevention, *Pathways for Peace*, identifies that the greatest risks of violence today stem from the mobilization of **perceptions of exclusion and injustice**, which are rooted in deep-seated inequalities between different identity groups. Critically, it is not inequality alone that drives conflict, but the *perception* of exclusion, particularly when blame for this condition is assigned to the state or to other groups. This dynamic creates a fertile ground for mobilization toward violence.  \[3\]

These grievances manifest and are contested within several key societal domains, or **"arenas of contestation."** Understanding these arenas is vital for identifying flashpoints and designing effective preventive action:

* ***Power and Governance:*** Contests over political inclusion, fair representation in government, and the peaceful transfer of power. Exclusion from decision-making processes is a primary source of grievance.

* ***Land and Natural Resources:*** Disputes over the access to, distribution of, and benefits derived from land and extractive resources. These are often exacerbated by scarcity, environmental stress, and historical injustices.

* ***Service Delivery:*** Grievances arising from perceived unfairness, corruption, or systemic exclusion in the provision of basic public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

* ***Security and Justice:*** Tensions driven by predatory, partial, or exclusionary state security forces and justice systems that are inaccessible, discriminatory, or fail to protect all citizens equally.  
  \[3\]

Once a conflict begins, its trajectory is increasingly difficult to reverse. Modern conflicts are now less likely to end in formal peace agreements and are far more likely to become internationalized, drawing in external actors who prolong the violence.\[3\] The Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) has identified nine key factors that significantly increase the likelihood of a conflict escalating in severity and intensity:

1. Urban origin onset

2. Accessible terrain

3. High logistical supply for warring parties

4. Possession of heavy weapons by non-state actors

5. Significant external support to warring parties

6. Presence of private military contractors

7. High levels of ethnic exclusion

8. Fratricidal coercion within armed groups

9. Instrumentalization of the conflict for ideological or political goals  
   \[3\]

Recognizing that these complex, interconnected factors drive the emergence and escalation of conflict demands a new methodology for analysis and policymaking, one that can comprehend and influence the dynamics of an entire societal system.

## **3.0 The Positive Peace Framework: A Systems-Thinking Approach to Building Sustainable Societies**

Systems thinking provides a powerful methodology for understanding and influencing complex societal challenges like conflict. In contrast to traditional, linear analyses that isolate individual problems, a systems approach examines the web of interdependencies, feedback loops, and hidden patterns that shape societal outcomes. For policymakers, this holistic perspective is invaluable, allowing for more forward-looking decisions that anticipate unintended consequences and identify high-leverage points for intervention.

At the core of a systems-based approach to peace is the concept of **Positive Peace**, defined as "the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies."\[4\] This is distinct from Negative Peace, which is merely the absence of direct violence. Positive Peace is a proactive, constructive framework that identifies the foundational elements of social well-being and resilience. Societies with high levels of Positive Peace are not only less violent but are also statistically linked to a host of other desirable outcomes, including:

* Higher GDP growth

* Better environmental performance

* Higher measures of well-being

* Stronger resilience to shocks  
  \[5\]

Adopting a systems approach to build Positive Peace involves understanding several key concepts that govern how complex systems behave.

**Table 2: Key Concepts in Systems Thinking for Peacebuilding**

| Concept | Policy-Relevant Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Feedback Loops** | The dynamic process where the output of an action is "fed back" into the system, either reinforcing the original action (a virtuous or vicious cycle) or counteracting it. Understanding these loops helps predict how interventions will cascade through a society. |
| **Tipping Points** | Critical thresholds where a small change can trigger a sudden, dramatic, and often irreversible shift in the entire system. Identifying potential tipping points is crucial for preventing negative shifts (like state collapse) or encouraging positive ones. |
| **Resilience vs. Efficiency** | **Resilience** is a system's ability to absorb and recover from shocks, often due to built-in redundancies. **Efficiency** maximizes output with minimal resources. An over-emphasis on efficiency can make a system brittle and vulnerable to shocks. |
| **Emergence and Sunsetting** | **Emergence** refers to new properties and behaviors that arise from the interaction of a system's parts (e.g., a sudden rise in innovation). **Sunsetting** is the decline or disappearance of old structures or behaviors as the system evolves. |

The concept of resilience is particularly instructive. Following major ecological shocks, Japan and Haiti experienced dramatically different outcomes. Japan, with a high Positive Peace score, demonstrated strong resilience; its systems absorbed the shock, enabling recovery and adaptation. Haiti, with a very low Positive Peace score, had minimal resilience, and the shock triggered a catastrophic breakdown of its internal structures. This comparison starkly illustrates that a system's internal strength and structure, its level of Positive Peace, are more decisive in determining outcomes than the external shock itself. \[6\]

This systems framework provides a powerful lens for analysis. It can be operationalized through specific tools designed to help policymakers monitor systemic risks and identify threats before they reach a crisis point.

## **4.0 Operationalizing the Framework: The Normandy Index as a Strategic Foresight Tool**

To effectively implement a systems-thinking approach, policymakers need practical tools to monitor the complex web of interconnected threats that can undermine peace. The **Normandy Index** serves as precisely such an instrument. Developed as a tool to help guide EU external action, it provides a holistic, data-driven picture of the threats to peace and security within and across nations. \[7\]

The Normandy Index defines conflict not as an isolated event, but as a product of factors linked to 11 main threats identified in the EU's external action strategy. These threats represent the key domains where systemic weaknesses can cascade into instability and violence. \[7\]

* **Climate Change**

* **Cybersecurity**

* **Democratic Processes**

* **Economic Crises**

* **Energy Insecurity**

* **Fragile States**

* **Criminality/Homicide**

* **Resilience to Disinformation**

* **Terrorism**

* **Violent Conflicts**

* **Weapons of Mass Destruction**

The rationale behind the Normandy Index is to serve as both an early-warning system and a strategic foresight tool. By aggregating data across these 11 domains, it helps policymakers assess the probability of conflict in a given country based on its overall level of systemic stress. This allows for more targeted, proactive, and effective external action, helping to direct diplomatic, development, and security resources to where they are most needed to prevent destabilization.

Leveraging these systemic insights requires a clear commitment to a set of strategic imperatives that reorient policy from reaction to prevention.

## **5.0 Strategic Imperatives for 21st-Century Peacebuilding**

Effective peacebuilding in the modern era requires a fundamental strategic shift: from a posture of reactive crisis management to one of proactive, systemic resilience-building. The evidence is clear that preventing conflict is profoundly more effective, both morally and economically, than intervening after violence has taken hold. For policymakers, this reality demands a new set of strategic priorities grounded in a deeper understanding of societal dynamics.

1. **Prioritize Inclusivity as a Core Security Interest.** Recognize that addressing horizontal inequalities and the perception of exclusion is a primary mechanism for preventing conflict. National and international policy must actively work to ensure that all groups have equitable access and representation within the key "arenas of contestation", namely, political governance, economic resources, public services, and the justice and security sectors. \[3\]

2. **Adopt a Systems-Thinking Mindset.** Move beyond analyzing challenges in isolation and instead view them as interconnected parts of a dynamic societal system. Policymakers must actively seek to understand and anticipate feedback loops, identify potential tipping points before they are crossed, and consider the second- and third-order consequences of all interventions to avoid inadvertently exacerbating tensions. \[4\]

3. **Invest Proactively in Positive Peace and Resilience.** Rebalance strategic priorities and financial resources, recognizing that for every dollar invested in peacebuilding, the costs associated with conflict deaths and GDP losses have grown by over 400% since 2008\. The imperative is to shift from costly post-conflict military and humanitarian interventions toward long-term investment in the attitudes, institutions, and structures that sustain peace. This is the most effective way to build a society's inherent capacity to manage shocks and resolve disputes without resorting to violence. \[5\]

4. **Leverage Data-Driven Foresight for Early Action.** Systematically integrate analytical tools like the Normandy Index and conflict escalation models into the policy cycle. Using data to identify emerging systemic risks allows for timely and targeted diplomatic and development interventions, creating opportunities to de-escalate tensions and address grievances long before they reach a point of crisis. \[1\]\[7\]

By embracing a more strategic, inclusive, and systemic framework, building a more peaceful and prosperous world is not a distant aspiration but an achievable policy goal.
