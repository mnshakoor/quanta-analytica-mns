## **I. Executive Summary: Strategic Context and Key Risk Synthesis**

The Islamic Republic of Mauritania presents a complex risk profile characterized by a fundamental dichotomy: externally approved fiscal stability contrasted with deep-seated internal socio-political fragility. Macroeconomic management, driven by cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB), has resulted in declining inflation, tight fiscal consolidation, and a moderate risk of debt distress, positioning the economy for projected medium-term growth.1 This stability, however, appears to be achieved through a governance model that suppresses civil liberties and structurally maintains profound social inequalities.

Mauritania’s stability is threatened by three major interlinked challenges:

1. **Structural Social Inequality:** The nation’s social contract is fundamentally compromised by deep stratification. The Haratin population, constituting 40% of the populace, faces persistent social, economic, and political exclusion rooted in descent-based slavery, which remains an enduring issue despite legal prohibitions.3 This systemic exclusion represents an internal fault line capable of undermining long-term political stability.  
2. **Repressive Governance:** While formal political structures exist, the regime employs overly broad, repressive legal mechanisms—including severe penalties for blasphemy and the spread of "false information"—to stifle dissent, prosecute human rights defenders, and control the flow of information.4 The consideration by the US Congress of the Mauritania TPS Act (H.R. 7034\) reflects an official external recognition of severe, destabilizing domestic conditions.6  
3. **Compounding External Stressors:** The country is highly vulnerable to environmental factors (aridity, desertification) which exacerbate food insecurity and internal migration. These challenges are amplified by an immense humanitarian burden, hosting approximately 170,000 Malian refugees and serving as a critical transit hub for 500,000 irregular migrants en route to Europe.2 This humanitarian load strains public services and contributes significantly to the elevated rates of violent crime observed in the capital.7

Strategic assessments must balance the opportunities arising from macroeconomic reforms and resource wealth against the high probability of socio-political shocks arising from structural inequality and environmental distress.

## **II. PESTELS Analysis of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania**

### **A. Political Environment (P)**

#### **1\. Government Structure, Stability, and Governance Issues**

Mauritania, officially *Al-Jumhūriyyah al-Islāmiyyah al-Mūrītāniyyah*, functions as an Islamic Republic.8 Executive power is held by the President, Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ghazouani, who is assisted by Prime Minister Mokhtar Ould Diay.8 The nation gained independence from France on November 28, 1960\.8

The legislative function is bicameral.9 The parliament consists of the higher house, the Majilis al-Shuyukh (Senate), which has 53 members elected by indirect vote and three reserved for the diaspora, serving six-year terms.9 The lower house, Jamiya Al Wataniya (National Assembly), has 81 members elected in single and multi-member constituencies and 14 members elected through a closed-list proportional representation system, serving five-year terms.9 The current government's policy framework, evolving into

*Mon ambition pour la nation*, is structured around five strategic pillars designed to guide national development: institutional governance, economic resilience, human capital development, social inclusion, and security.2 Specific commitments include combating corruption, empowering youth, and improving agriculture and education.2

#### **2\. The Governance Paradox: Fiscal Health vs. Political Repression**

Mauritania faces a fundamental contradiction in its governance model. On one hand, the government receives substantial approval from international financial institutions for its handling of economic affairs. The country has demonstrated sound macroeconomic management and a commitment to reform, which has strengthened debt sustainability and resilience to shocks.1 This success facilitates access to facilities like the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).1

However, this fiscal stabilization exists concurrently with severe political repression. The political system utilizes instruments of legal control to maintain power and suppress dissent. Repressive laws concerning criminal defamation, spreading "false information," cybercrime, and blasphemy are routinely employed to prosecute and jail human rights defenders, activists, journalists, and bloggers.4 An overly broad law stipulates harsh prison sentences and fines for the publication of "false news".5 Furthermore, security forces have used excessive force to disperse peaceful protests, violating fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and expression.4 The government’s strategic action appears to prioritize maintaining external fiscal legitimacy—which secures vital international loans and aid—over implementing genuine internal political liberalization and respecting civil rights. This approach significantly reduces immediate economic risk but simultaneously accumulates long-term sociopolitical instability, as stifled dissent creates a high potential for future, more disruptive political shocks that could unravel fiscal gains.

#### **3\. Relations with International Partners**

Engagement with partners, particularly the IMF and World Bank, is robust, as evidenced by multiple ongoing review processes for economic arrangements.1 Mauritania is also a vital partner in EU migration control strategies, acting as a crucial transit point for migrants en route to Europe.2 This role, while strategically important, has been criticized, with reports highlighting abuses associated with migration control.5 A major indicator of international concern is the introduction of the Mauritania TPS Act (H.R. 7034\) in the US Congress in January 2024\.6 This legislative action reflects official concern regarding severe, destabilizing conditions in the country, likely related to the endemic human rights violations, and creates diplomatic friction by publicly affirming that domestic conditions are unsafe for returning nationals.

### **B. Economic Environment (E)**

#### **1\. Macroeconomic Fundamentals and Key Sectors**

The Mauritanian economy has shown resilience but is subject to deceleration. Economic growth, estimated at 6.5% in 2023, declined to 5.1% in 2024 (per capita growth of 2.1%).2 Real GDP growth is projected to slow further to 4.4% in 2025\.1 Growth drivers include strong export performance and resilient private consumption, although these were partially offset by a slowdown in key extractive industries, specifically gold and iron ore production, and weaker public consumption.2

Inflation has been relatively well-managed, falling to 1.5% year-on-year in December 2024, down from 1.6% in 2023\. This drop is attributed to tight monetary policy implemented by the Central Bank and lower global prices for food and fuel.2 Consumer prices are projected to rise slightly to 3.5% in 2025\.1

Fiscal performance has been strong, with consolidation measures leading to a reduction in the budget deficit to 0.1% of GDP in 2024, a significant decrease from 2.4% in 2023\. This achievement was facilitated by increased revenues, particularly from telecommunications taxes and withholding taxes on extractive industries, alongside effective spending control.2 The debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to 44.5%, and the country is assessed to be at a moderate risk of debt distress.2

#### **2\. Sectoral Vulnerability and Future Growth Dependence**

While the financial metrics appear robust, the economy's dependence on primary sectors introduces significant vulnerability. The deceleration in GDP growth highlights the sensitivity of the national economy to commodity price volatility and production slowdowns in the mining sector (iron ore and gold).2 Furthermore, the IMF has explicitly recommended that the government focus on improving administration of hydrocarbon tax revenues.1 This emphasis suggests that future fiscal stability and continued debt reduction are highly contingent on the successful exploitation and management of emerging oil and gas resources. This transition trades volatility in existing mining commodities for long-term dependence risk inherent in a nascent resource economy lacking broad diversification.

The international institutions stress structural reform to achieve inclusive growth, recommending enhanced revenue mobilization and the strengthening of banking supervision.1 The World Bank's engagement highlights the critical importance of the livestock sector to poverty reduction, supporting resilience projects for agro-pastoral communities.2

Table 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators and Debt Profile

| Indicator | 2023 Actual | 2024 Estimate | 2025 Projected | Strategic Implication | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Real GDP Growth (%) | 6.5 | 5.1 | 4.4 | Decelerating growth requires urgent diversification. | 1 |
| Inflation (YoY %) | 1.6 | 1.5 (Dec 2024\) | 3.5 | Recent control via monetary policy, 2025 projection reflects external pressures. | 1 |
| Budget Deficit (% GDP) | 2.4 | 0.1 | N/A | Strong fiscal consolidation achieved through revenue enhancement. | 2 |
| Debt-to-GDP Ratio (%) | N/A | 44.5 | N/A | Moderate risk profile maintained, supported by IMF/WB oversight. | 2 |

#### **3\. Climate Change and Debt Interaction**

The country’s moderate risk of debt distress is inextricably linked to its extreme climate vulnerability. The IMF supports Mauritania through the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) for implementing adaptation and mitigation measures.1 This technical support acknowledges that the nation’s ability to manage its debt portfolio and fiscal stability depends heavily on its capacity to withstand climate shocks. Given that only 0.5% of the land is arable 2 and much of the economy relies on pastoralism and fishing (inferred from export strength), a severe drought or environmental failure could trigger massive humanitarian spending requirements. Such unplanned expenditure would immediately undermine fiscal discipline and push the debt risk profile toward a higher level of distress, demonstrating how environmental factors compound sovereign risk.

### **C. Social Environment (S)**

#### **1\. Social Stratification and The Exclusionary Threat**

Mauritania’s population is deeply stratified along ethnic and historical lines, which forms a significant barrier to achieving inclusive development. The population is divided into three primary ethnic groups 3:

* **Black Moors (Haratines):** Constituting 40% of the population, they are Arab-speaking but are descendants of slaves and former slaves of African origin, experiencing systemic political, social, and economic exclusion.3  
* **White Moors (Beydane):** Making up 30%, these are individuals of Arab-Berber descent who traditionally hold political and economic power.3  
* **Sub-Saharan Mauritanians:** Representing the remaining 30%, this group consists of non-Arabic speaking communities like the Halpulaar, Fulani, Soninke, and Wolof, many of whom reside in or originate from the Senegal River Valley.3

This pronounced structural inequality poses a severe long-term threat to internal stability. While the government identifies "social inclusion" as a strategic pillar 2, the failure to politically and economically integrate the largest demographic group (the Haratines) generates perpetual underlying conflict risk and inhibits equitable resource distribution.

#### **2\. Human Rights Conditions and Slavery Persistence**

The persistence of slavery is Mauritania’s most profound human rights concern. Despite multiple laws banning descent-based and modern forms of slavery and the establishment of specialized courts to prosecute perpetrators, the practice has not been eradicated.4 A UN Special Rapporteur report noted the continued exclusion faced by currently and formerly enslaved individuals and their descendants.4 Crucially, victims often lack knowledge of their fundamental rights or the established legal processes necessary for seeking redress, minimizing the effectiveness of existing anti-slavery legislation.4

Beyond slavery, severe restrictions on civil liberties are commonplace. The parliament has yet to pass a draft law on violence against women and girls introduced in 2016\.5 Furthermore, administrative obstacles, such as daunting civil registration requirements, prevent children from accessing education.5

#### **3\. Migration, Urbanization, and Security Overlap**

Mauritania is struggling under the weight of massive migratory pressures. More than half of the population (61.3%) lives in urban areas 2, a trend exacerbated by environmental pressures and conflict. The country hosts approximately 170,000 Malian refugees in the Mbera camp due to insecurity in Mali.2 Additionally, the capital, Nouakchott, serves as a crucial transit point for Europe-bound migrants, hosting an estimated 500,000 irregular migrants.2

This convergence of high urbanization and massive refugee/migrant influx strains public resources and social cohesion. This pressure directly feeds the domestic security challenges, contributing to the high rates of violent crime—including mugging, armed robbery, and assault—frequently observed outside the safer, wealthier neighborhoods of Nouakchott.7 The resulting resource strain complicates the government's ability to maintain public services and effective policing.

Table 2: Ethnic Stratification and Social Exclusion Fault Lines

| Ethnic Group | Approximate Population Share (%) | Linguistic Linkage | Socio-Economic Status/Exclusion | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Black Moors (Haratines) | 40% | Arabic (Hassaniya) | Face systemic exclusion; descendants of slaves; victims lack redress. | 3 |
| White Moors (Beydane) | 30% | Arabic (Hassaniya) | Traditionally dominant ruling/economic class. | 3 |
| Sub-Saharan Africans | 30% | Fula, Soninke, Wolof, Serer | Largely based in river valley; marginalized in urban economic life. | 3 |

### **D. Technological Environment (T)**

#### **1\. Infrastructure and Connectivity**

The technological environment is characterized by extremely high costs and low penetration. Mauritania holds the distinction of having some of the world's most expensive internet costs.10 Out of an estimated population of 4.7 million, only about 969,519 individuals have internet access, indicating penetration is around 20%.10 Low speeds and connectivity prices pose significant barriers to economic modernization and educational development.10

#### **2\. Technology in Governance and Research**

Despite connectivity challenges, there is a push for scientific advancement. Mauritania has established a National Research and Education Network (NREN), becoming the seventh African Arab country to do so.10 The NREN is intended to connect research institutions and universities nationally and regionally, providing access to essential educational resources.10

Paradoxically, the government employs technological tools for control. Mobile internet access has been shut down multiple times, both following political protests (such as the death of Oumar Diop) and, purportedly, to prevent cheating during high school exams.4 This practice reveals a governance structure that is willing to invest in controlled, high-value technological access for research but fears widespread, unregulated connectivity that could facilitate civil organization and dissent. The restrictive nature of internet access, whether due to high costs or state shutdowns, functions as a tool of social control that ultimately limits the broader societal benefits of technological adoption.

### **E. Environmental Environment (E)**

Mauritania is predominantly a desert country, with its relief and drainage profoundly influenced by aridity.8 The landscape is dominated by

*regs* (packed pebbles) and vast dune fields covering about half the national territory, with a climate defined by northeastern trade winds and the hot, dry *harmattan* wind.8 Arable land is acutely scarce, estimated at only 0.5% of the total land area.2

This geography makes the country highly susceptible to desertification, chronic drought, and water scarcity. These environmental factors are structural drivers of instability, forcing internal migration toward urban centers and eroding the resilience of pastoralist communities.2 The World Bank's Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS) is directly aimed at strengthening the resilience of (agro)pastoral communities, underscoring the vital, yet vulnerable, role of the livestock sector.2 International efforts, notably the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility, are essential for financing adaptation measures to mitigate these medium- to long-term challenges.1

### **F. Legal and Regulatory Environment (L)**

#### **1\. Systemic Failure in Human Rights Law**

The legal system formally operates under the 1991 constitution, which, while declaring Islam the official state religion, guarantees religious liberty.8 However, the rule of law is inconsistently applied, particularly concerning human rights and civil liberties.

The most egregious failure is the non-enforcement of anti-slavery laws. Despite the establishment of laws and specialized courts to prosecute slavery, the descent-based practice persists, and victims struggle to access justice.4 This systemic legal bias ensures that the judiciary protects the established power structure and ideology rather than enforcing equitable development goals promoted by external partners.2

Furthermore, the state uses highly repressive laws to suppress political speech. Laws related to criminal defamation, cybercrime, and the capital crime of blasphemy against the prophet are weaponized against government critics.4 A notable recent case involved a 19-year-old student who was detained for "insulting and backbiting the prophet" on a baccalaureate exam, facing a possible death sentence.4

#### **2\. Significance of the Mauritania TPS Act (H.R. 7034\)**

The legislative proposal, H.R. 7034, known as the Mauritania TPS Act of 2024, was introduced in the US House of Representatives on January 18, 2024\.6 The bill proposes designating Mauritania for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for an initial 18-month period.6

A TPS designation is reserved for countries facing conditions such as ongoing conflict or extraordinary circumstances that render the return of nationals unsafe. The introduction of this bill is significant because it represents an external diplomatic assessment by a major global power, legally affirming that the state of human rights and security in Mauritania—particularly the persistence of slavery and systematic violence—constitutes a grave, destabilizing crisis.6 This public acknowledgment directly contradicts the government's efforts to portray an image of increasing stability and good governance and holds potential negative implications for its relationships with countries relying on Mauritania for migration control.

### **G. Security Environment (S)**

Mauritania faces a complex, two-tiered security threat combining localized high-frequency violent crime with persistent regional terrorism.

#### **1\. Internal Conflict and Law Enforcement Capacity**

Internal security is challenged by high rates of violent crime, including assault, mugging, and armed robbery, which frequently occur outside the most affluent neighborhoods of Nouakchott.7 Local law enforcement possesses limited resources and often cannot respond effectively or rapidly to serious criminal incidents.7 The high volume of irregular migrants and refugees in urban centers, combined with structural poverty and unemployment, fuels this domestic crime threat.2

#### **2\. Regional and External Security Threats**

The country is situated on the volatile boundary between the Sahel and the Maghrib, making it susceptible to regional instability. Terrorism is a constant threat, with attacks potentially occurring with little or no warning and specifically targeting locations frequented by Western expatriates.7 Consequently, the US Department of State has designated certain areas as "Level 4: Do Not Travel" zones.7

This security environment introduces a structural strain on fiscal resources, which must be diverted to both domestic policing (to address urban violent crime) and international counter-terrorism efforts (to protect borders and critical infrastructure). The high-risk environment and limited infrastructure outside the capital deter Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and hinder technical assistance projects, especially those requiring access to remote, resource-rich areas.7

Table 3: Critical Governance and Security Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Area | Key Concern | Impact Type | Source Context | Strategic Significance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Slavery/Discrimination | Persistence of descent-based slavery and systemic exclusion of Haratines. | Social/Legal | Despite laws, victims lack information on rights/redress. | Deep structural inequality undermining WB inclusion efforts. |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| Rule of Law (Civil Liberties) | Use of blasphemy (death penalty risk) and false news laws against dissent. | Political/Legal | Jailing of activists; internet shutdowns during protests/exams. | Undermines democratic appearance and foreign confidence in governance. |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| Regional Security | High violent crime in cities, combined with regional terrorism targeting Westerners. | Security/Economic | Police lack resources; Level 4 travel advisories for specific areas. | Increases operational costs for investors and strains fiscal security budget. |
| 7 |  |  |  |  |
| Migration Policy (US) | H.R. 7034 introduced to designate Mauritania for Temporary Protected Status. | Political/Diplomatic | Signals official US concern over severe, destabilizing domestic conditions. | High risk indicator validating human rights groups’ findings. |
| 6 |  |  |  |  |

## **III. Cultural, Linguistic, and Demographic Norms Breakdown**

### **A. Demographic Profile**

Mauritania’s population is estimated at 4.629 million 1, making it one of the least densely populated countries globally.2 However, the country has undergone a rapid demographic shift toward urbanization, with 61.3% of Mauritanians living in urban centers as of 2024\.2 This concentration of population in areas like the capital, Nouakchott, creates immense pressure on resources, infrastructure, and social services.

The primary demographic tension arises from the ethnic composition: the Haratines (40%) and Beydane (30%) are Arab-speaking groups, while Sub-Saharan African groups (30%) speak various non-Arabic languages, creating a clear socio-economic and political division that often aligns with the historic slave/master distinction.3

### **B. Cultural Norms and Social Dynamics**

As an Islamic Republic, Islam is central to Mauritanian law and traditional customs.8 The country’s geographic position means it functions as a cultural bridge connecting the Arab-Amazigh Maghrib to the western sub-Saharan African populations.8 This location defines a complex national identity.

Traditional nomadic life, which once encompassed a large proportion of the population, has diminished significantly since the droughts of the 1970s, contributing to the accelerating urbanization trend.8 Gender roles remain traditional, reflected in the legal environment where a draft law addressing violence against women and girls has been stalled since 2016\.5

### **C. Linguistic Landscape**

The official language of Mauritania is Arabic.8 However, the linguistic environment is multilingual, with Fula, Soninke, and Wolof officially designated as national languages under the 1991 constitution.8 French, the language of the former colonial administration, remains widely used in media, commerce, and likely government bureaucracy.3

The socio-linguistic environment reinforces ethnic stratification. The dominance of Arabic and French in official and economic spheres likely creates a severe barrier for the 30% of the population comprising Sub-Saharan groups, whose primary languages are constitutionally recognized but often marginalized in practice.3 This language bias restricts access to education, employment, and political participation for non-Arabic speakers, thereby structurally impeding the realization of equitable human capital development goals.2

## **IV. Strategic Conclusions and Actionable Recommendations**

### **A. Synthesis of Interconnected Risks**

The analysis demonstrates that Mauritania's primary risks are systemic and interconnected, forming two self-reinforcing cycles:

**1\. The Governance and Exclusion Loop:** The political strategy relies on maximizing external economic legitimacy (via debt reduction and IMF adherence) while minimizing internal democratic accountability. This model mandates the suppression of dissent (via repressive laws and internet control) and, crucially, the structural continuation of socio-economic exclusion for the Haratin majority (via non-enforcement of anti-slavery laws).2 This stability is illusory, as structural inequality generates severe long-term fragility.

**2\. The Climate-Migration-Security Chain:** Environmental pressures, driven by aridity and desertification, reduce the viability of rural livelihoods (pastoralism).2 This compels internal migration, adding to the immense burden of external refugees and migrants, which then strains urban infrastructure and social safety nets.2 The resulting overcrowding and resource competition directly contribute to the observed rise in urban violent crime and resource competition.7

### **B. Policy Recommendations for International Partners**

1. **Conditionality on Judicial and Social Reform:** Financial aid and development support should be stringently conditioned on measurable progress in two specific areas: the immediate, transparent prosecution of slavery cases and the repeal of laws that weaponize speech (blasphemy, "false news") against political opponents.4 Programs must be established to ensure that formerly enslaved individuals are fully educated regarding their rights and processes for seeking redress.4  
2. **Integrated Migration and Urban Development Strategy:** Recognize that the migration crisis is fundamentally an urban planning challenge. Support must shift from merely managing refugee camps to investing heavily in the infrastructure, policing capacity, and public services of major urban centers, such as Nouakchott, to mitigate the social strain and high crime rates generated by rapid, unplanned population influx.2

### **C. Investment Recommendations and Risk Mitigation**

1. **Risk Management in Extractive Sectors:** Investment strategies in the resource sector (mining and nascent hydrocarbons) must incorporate a high-risk premium for political instability rooted in ethnic and economic inequality.3 Investors should implement advanced monitoring programs to ensure compliance with international anti-slavery and labor standards, given the documented failure of domestic legal enforcement.4  
2. **Targeted Digital Infrastructure Investment:** While generalized internet penetration is low and expensive, investment should target the high-potential NREN initiative.10 This represents an opportunity to enhance human capital and specialized R\&D. However, due diligence must account for the government's demonstrated willingness to impose digital blackouts for control purposes, necessitating resilience and contingency planning in digital operations.4  
3. **Comprehensive Security Planning:** Operational security planning must adopt a dual-threat approach. Security resources must be allocated not only for counter-terrorism efforts in high-risk zones but also for mitigating the elevated threat of organized and opportunistic violent crime targeting expatriates in urban environments.7 The assessment of police resource deficiencies must inform private security supplementation strategies.
