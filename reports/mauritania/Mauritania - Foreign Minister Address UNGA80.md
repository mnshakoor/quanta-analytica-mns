1:57
ladies and gentlemen,
2:00
I'm pleased to convey to you uh the
2:03
greetings of his excellency Mr. Muhammad
2:06
Wilshik Razwani, president of the
2:08
Islamic Republic of Moritania and his

2:17
His Excellency honored me by allowing me
2:20
to deliver on his behalf the address of
2:23
the Islamic Republic of Maritania.
2:26
This session
2:28
of course and naturally represents an
2:31
opportunity to celebrate 80 years of
2:34
achievements by our organization in the
2:37
service of humanity as a whole and in
2:40
various fields.
2:43
But it is also an opportunity to
2:46
objectively diagnose the major
2:50
shortcomings and deficiencies that have
2:54
characterized this or that aspect of the
2:57
UN's journey over the past eight
3:00
decades.
3:04
In this context,
3:08
it is clear that our world today
3:11
consists of two contrasting realms, two
3:15
contrasting worlds. One is rapidly
3:18
advancing toward the fourth industrial
3:21
revolution and artificial intelligence,
3:24
while the other remains
3:28
hostage to poverty and marginalization.
3:32
This gap, this ever widening gap,
3:36
particularly in view of the current
3:38
context of growing conflicts and wars.
3:42
This gap presents a difficult test to
3:46
humanity.
3:48
It requires us to unite our efforts
3:53
to devise solutions that are capable of
3:57
narrowing this gap by achieving just and
4:01
comprehensive human centered development
4:05
and the right of every human to a
4:07
dignified life.
4:09
The theme of our session today reflects
4:14
and accurately captures this noble goal.
4:19
Better together 80 years and more for
4:23
peace, development and human rights.
4:29
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
4:33
the session is convened amidst a global
4:37
context that is extremely complex and
4:40
challenging.
4:43
We see tensions, wars,
4:47
conflicts that are escalating in various
4:50
regions.
4:52
We see also the exacerbating
4:56
effects of terrorist threats and natural
4:58
disasters
5:00
resulting from climate change.
5:03
Human suffering is increasing and the
5:06
humanitarian burdens on entire
5:09
populations are multiplying.
5:12
This exposes international peace and
5:15
stability to increasing risks and
5:19
reinforces the need for a more effective
5:23
role of the UN.
5:27
Amidst all of this, the genocidal war
5:30
being waged against our people in Gaza
5:33
is a true litmous test to the human
5:36
conscience and the credibility of the
5:38
international system.
5:42
We in the Islamic Republic of Maritania
5:49
condemn this aggression and this
5:54
genocidal war and reiterate our support
5:57
for the Palestinian people.
6:00
And we stress
6:02
that violence cannot bring lasting peace
6:06
and security
6:10
and that stability in the Middle East as
6:13
a whole depends inevitably
6:17
on enabling the brotherly Palestinian
6:20
people
6:22
to realize their right to establish an
6:26
independent state with East Jerusalem as
6:29
its capital in line with relevant
6:32
international resolutions and the Arab
6:35
peace initiative.
6:38
In this context,
6:40
we are pleased to have seen the momentum
6:44
and the efforts to recognize the palis
6:48
the state of Palestine
6:50
that was powerfully demonstrated by the
6:55
overwhelming vote in the UN General
6:58
Assembly in favor of the New York
7:00
declaration on the implementation of the
7:03
two-state solution which was the outcome
7:06
of the high level international ational
7:08
conference that was held in July 2025
7:13
at the initiative of the Kingdom of
7:15
Saudi Arabia and the Republic of France.
7:20
I have here to uh thank on behalf of my
7:24
country the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and
7:28
the Republic of France for organizing
7:31
the aforementioned conference despite
7:35
all the challenges and the obstacles.
7:39
I commend the positions of those
7:41
countries that have recognized the state
7:44
of Palestine and I hope that other
7:48
countries will follow suit
7:52
in upholding the principles of truth and
7:55
justice until Palestine becomes a full
8:00
member of the United Nations.
8:06
In the same vein, my country reiterates
8:10
its strong condemnation of the recent
8:13
Israeli aggression against the brotherly
8:16
state of Qatar, which constitutes a
8:19
flagrant violation of this country's
8:22
sovereignity and of all international
8:25
norms and conventions.
8:28
We also affirm our support for peaceful
8:32
solutions in Libya, Sudan, Yemen, and
8:36
Syria.
8:38
We support all international efforts
8:41
regarding Western Sahara.
8:44
And we call for a negotiated end to the
8:48
Russia Ukraine war to spare the world
8:52
further tragedies.
8:56
At the same time, we commend the peace
8:58
agreements between Rwanda and the
9:01
Democratic Republic of Congo on the one
9:04
hand and between Pakistan and India on
9:06
the other.
9:08
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
9:14
in a world where conflicts, poverty,
9:17
disease, climate change are burdening
9:20
humanity,
9:22
the need is more urgent for more just
9:25
and effective international and global
9:28
political, economic, and health
9:30
governance that places and prioritizes
9:34
human life and dignity.
9:37
This can only be achieved through a
9:40
balanced reform that restores confidence
9:43
in the United Nations and renders the
9:46
organization more capable of fulfilling
9:49
its noble purposes and goals of
9:52
safeguarding peace and security and
9:55
building a more equitable world.
9:59
Accordingly, my country renews its
10:03
commit
10:04
its commitment to the legitimate demands
10:06
of our African continent as set out in
10:09
the ESini
10:11
uh consensus for equitable
10:14
representation in global governance
10:17
structures. We call the international
10:20
community to support developing
10:22
countries in addressing challenges of
10:26
food security, climate change, the
10:29
problem of debt and to support their
10:32
efforts towards achieving the
10:34
sustainable development goals. Madame
10:37
President, ladies and gentlemen,
10:41
the Islamic Republic of Moritania
10:45
places
10:46
a high priority on the strengthening of
10:48
the rule of law and good governance, the
10:51
consolidation of values of justice and
10:53
equality as its top priority.
10:58
Therefore, we have implemented a range
11:02
of strategies and reforms aiming at
11:06

11:09
of public affairs, reforming and
11:12
enhancing the independence of judiciary,
11:15
supporting the role of the parliament in
11:17
oversight and accountability.
11:19
This will ensure uh fighting against
11:22
corruption and the protection of rights
11:24
and freedoms as well as strengthening
11:27
the trust among the different national
11:29
components. In the same context and in
11:33
an attempt to reinforce our status and
11:36

11:38
