## **Comparative Alignment Matrix: Act No. 2020-017 vs. Proposed INCHTMS Bylaws**

| Article / Theme | Act No. 2020-017 Provision | Proposed Bylaws Provision | Gap / Added Value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Legal Basis & Purpose** | Establishes INCHTMS as the national anti-trafficking body | Expands mandate into prevention, data, NAP oversight, victim protection, and reporting | Law provides foundation only; bylaws add operational detail and broader scope |
| **Governance & Membership** | Mentions interministerial coordination | Defines Chair, Vice-Chair, Permanent Secretariat, core ministries, NGOs, diaspora, and observers | Law is silent on NGO, diaspora, and observer roles; bylaws fill inclusion gap |
| **Standing Committees** | General coordination mandate | Six specialized committees (Legal, Victims, Training, Data, Prevention, Donors) | Law does not specify committees; bylaws provide operational specialization |
| **Powers & Authority** | Provides coordination and reporting functions | Authority to require data, issue directives, maintain independent budget, escalate to Presidency | Binding directives and independent budget authority not explicit in law; bylaws strengthen enforcement |
| **Procedures & Operations** | Calls for reporting and data collection | Meeting schedules, decision-making rules, TIP dashboard, audits, regional subcommittees | Law lacks operational detail; bylaws provide structured governance and transparency mechanisms |
| **Ethical & Safeguards** | Provides victim protection clauses | Survivor participation, whistleblower protections, conflict-of-interest rules, data security | Law ensures protection but does not define governance ethics; bylaws introduce accountability and safeguards |
| **International Engagement** | Requires cooperation with international partners | Diaspora MoUs, donor coordination, structured liaison role for Secretariat | Law does not mention diaspora; bylaws extend outreach and strengthen partnerships |
| **Amendment & Review** | No amendment procedures defined | Two-thirds vote for amendment, five-year review cycle | Bylaws create accountability loop missing in the law |

Mauritania’s 2020 anti-trafficking law and its implementation architecture. Here is what is on record, followed by a quick comparison to your proposed INCHTMS bylaws.

# **What has changed or been proposed since 2020**

1. **Specialized court reform for slavery and trafficking cases**

* 2024 TIP narrative noted a **draft bill** to reform anti-slavery courts that was still pending at the time. [State.gov+1](https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-trafficking-in-persons-report/mauritania?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* That reform **moved forward** later in 2024\. The US Department of Labor’s 2024 TDA report says **a centralized special court** to handle slavery and trafficking nationwide was **enacted in Oct 2024**, replacing three regional anti-slavery courts and consolidating TIP jurisdiction. [DOL](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2024/Mauritania.pdf)

* Multiple outlets through 2024-2025 referenced the same shift to a unified specialized court structure. [أخبار شمال إفريقيا+1](https://nan.media/en/establishment-of-a-court-to-combat-slavery-and-human-trafficking-in-mauritania/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

2. **National Action Plan against TIP 2024-2026**

* Government **approved** a new NAP in March 2024\. It is framed as the integrated planning tool for identification, protection, assistance, and prosecution. [Ami+1](https://ami.mr/fr/archives/242936?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* IOM also highlights adoption and the presence of a national committee to combat trafficking and migrant smuggling. [Rodakar](https://rodakar.iom.int/blogs/trafficking-ends-here-mauritania-steps-anti-trafficking-efforts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. **Institutionalization of a national coordination mechanism**

* International reporting and government submissions describe a **decree-based institutional mechanism** to coordinate anti-trafficking and smuggling efforts, maintain a dedicated database, and strengthen victim protection. This aligns with the statutory intent behind INCHTMS. [national-cases.acerwc.africa](https://national-cases.acerwc.africa/sites/default/files/2025-07/Rapport%201%20P%C3%A9riodique%20de%20la%20Mauritanie%20CAEDBE.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

4. **UN Special Rapporteur recommendations \- migrant protection interface**

* September 2025 mission welcomed the legal framework but urged **stronger judicial oversight of migrant detention**, an **asylum law**, and safeguards against collective expulsions. These are adjacent to TIP enforcement and victim screening obligations. [JURIST+2OHCHR+2](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/09/un-expert-praises-mauritania-legal-reforms-but-raises-concern-over-migrant-rights-abuses/)

5. **Child labor and TIP enforcement ecosystem updates**

* The 2024 TDA report documents a **new NRM training rollout**, the special court, and labor code changes on light work age, all of which affect the victim identification and protection pipeline that the 2020 law depends on. [DOL](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2024/Mauritania.pdf)

# **How these updates compare to your proposed INCHTMS bylaws**

| Area | What is in play publicly | Fit with your bylaws | Gaps your bylaws still cover |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Court architecture** | Centralized special court enacted in Oct 2024 to handle slavery and TIP cases nationwide. [DOL](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2024/Mauritania.pdf) | Strong alignment. Your bylaws’ Legal and Judicial Committee can serve as an interface with the new court and standardize prosecutorial SOPs. | Your bylaws add clear data sharing rules, case tracking, and escalation powers that are not spelled out in public court notices. |
| **National Action Plan 2024-2026** | Approved and positioned as government’s integrated tool for TIP response. [Ami+1](https://ami.mr/fr/archives/242936?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Perfect fit. Your bylaws put INCHTMS in charge of NAP oversight, M\&E, and quarterly reporting. | Your bylaws add meeting cadence, audit cycles, and performance indicators missing from the public NAP communiqués. |
| **Coordination mechanism** | Government materials and treaty reports cite a decree establishing a robust national mechanism and database. [national-cases.acerwc.africa](https://national-cases.acerwc.africa/sites/default/files/2025-07/Rapport%201%20P%C3%A9riodique%20de%20la%20Mauritanie%20CAEDBE.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Confirms the concept behind INCHTMS. Your structure fills in the operational detail. | Your bylaws specify independent budget line, binding coordination directives, and regional nodes that are not visible in the decree excerpts. |
| **NRM implementation** | TIP 2024 urges full NRM implementation and front-line training. [State.gov](https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-trafficking-in-persons-report/mauritania?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Your bylaws create a Victim Protection and Referral Committee to enforce NRM compliance across actors. | Adds survivor participation, whistleblower protections, and confidentiality protocols that the TIP narrative recommends in spirit but does not codify. |
| **Migrant protection \- asylum and detention** | UN expert calls for an **asylum law** plus stronger legal safeguards in detention and against collective expulsions. [JURIST+1](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/09/un-expert-praises-mauritania-legal-reforms-but-raises-concern-over-migrant-rights-abuses/) | Your bylaws can host a Legal and Judicial Committee workstream to draft cross-walk SOPs so migrant screening and victim screening are integrated. | Your bylaws propose clear interagency SOPs and due process triggers that are not yet reflected in statute. This is an opportunity to advocate legislative or regulatory add-ons. |

# **Bottom line**

* The **headline legal update** since 2020 is the **2024 overhaul creating a centralized special court** for slavery and TIP cases, now operational per DOL. That is compatible with your governance design, and it strengthens prosecution pathways your bylaws expect to coordinate. [DOL](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2024/Mauritania.pdf)

* The **2024-2026 NAP** and references to a **decree-based national mechanism** affirm the INCHTMS concept, but **do not provide the granular governance, budget, data, or ethics architecture** you drafted. Your bylaws remain the missing operating system. [primature.gov.mr+1](https://primature.gov.mr/fr/node/1152?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* The **UN recommendations in 2025** open a lane to integrate **asylum and migrant detention safeguards** into the INCHTMS rulebook and, where possible, into statute or implementing decrees. Your bylaws can be leveraged as the coordination backbone for those cross-border protection duties. [JURIST](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/09/un-expert-praises-mauritania-legal-reforms-but-raises-concern-over-migrant-rights-abuses/)

If you want, I can now generate:

* A **one-page policy brief** that translates this comparison into specific legislative and bylaw text insertions.

* A **redline checklist** for Parliament or the Ministry of Justice showing exactly which clauses to add to give INCHTMS independent budget authority, binding directives, and regional nodes.

A **one-page policy brief** summary of the key legal updates and proposed texts you should push, and a **redline checklist** of bylaw insertions / legislative amendments to align our structure with evolving law and practice.

## **Policy Brief: Legal Landscape, Gaps & Strategic Recommendations**

**Mauritania – Anti-Trafficking Legal Update & Strategic Bylaw Insertions**

### **Current Legal & Institutional Changes**

* In **October 2024**, Mauritania passed and deployed a **centralized special court** to handle all slavery, trafficking in persons, and migrant smuggling cases. This replaces previous regional anti-slavery courts. [DOL+2State Department+2](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2024/Mauritania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* The government approved a **National Action Plan (NAP 2024-2026)**, directing coordination, victim protection, prosecution, and prevention efforts. [DOL+2Rodakar+2](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2024/Mauritania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Revisions to labor law: the Labor Code was amended in December 2024, raising the permissible age for light work from 12 to 14 (with restrictions) to reduce child labor vulnerabilities. [DOL](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2024/Mauritania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Initiatives in 2025: new migrant reception centers (CATEs) being established, standard operating procedures (SOPs) for boat disembarkation & migrant processing being formalized, and an internal plan to include interpreters in courts to reduce language barriers. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/08/27/they-accused-me-of-trying-to-go-to-europe/migration-control-abuses-and-eu?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **Gaps & Risks in the Current Law**

* The 2020 Act (No. 2020-017) provides a legal foundation, but lacks **detailed institutional architecture** (e.g. subnational nodes, binding budget authority, escalation procedures). [UN Documentation+1](https://docs.un.org/en/A/HRC/54/30/Add.2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Survivor protection, confidentiality, whistleblower protections, and conflict-of-interest rules are not well elaborated in the legal text.

* The law does not explicitly define amendment procedures, review cycles, or inclusion of diaspora participation & observer roles.

### **Strategic Recommendations (to embed into law or decrees / bylaws)**

1. **Embed your Institutional Architecture**

   * Codify powers for INCHTMS to issue binding directives, require data submissions, and escalate noncompliance.

   * Grant INCHTMS an **independent budget line** in legislation (or via decree) so coordination is not discretionary.

   * Recognize **regional / subnational TIP nodes** by law, with required link to INCHTMS.

2. **Strengthen Ethical and Safeguard Clauses**

   * Add legal protection for whistleblowers, rules for conflicts of interest, mandatory confidentiality protections, and survivor participation rights.

   * Mandate external audits and public annual reporting.

3. **Legal & Procedural Harmonization**

   * Amend rules to integrate asylum / migration law procedure (especially SOPs in disembarkation, detention, screening) into TIP law.

   * Law should require interpretation / translation services in legal proceedings involving victims or foreign nationals.

4. **Review & Amendment Mechanisms**

   * Embed internal amendment procedures (e.g. two-thirds plenary, Chair oversight) and mandated review cycles (e.g. every 5 years).

   * Require independent evaluations and civil society input.

5. **Legislate Survivor & NGO Roles**

   * Law should explicitly allow NGO / diaspora / survivor representation in INCHTMS and working groups.

   * Grant them observer or voting status in committees.

---

## **Redline Checklist: Bylaw Insertions & Legal Amendments**

Below is a checklist of proposed bylaw / legal insertions (each to be redlined into your draft or into an amendment to the law):

| Section | Proposed Text / Concept | Purpose / Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Powers & Authority** | “INCHTMS may issue binding coordination directives to member ministries, with legal force to require compliance, subject to oversight.” | To prevent noncompliance by agencies that might ignore coordination requests |
| **Budget Authority** | “INCHTMS is allocated an independent budget line within the national budget, controlled by its Secretariat, to fund coordination, grants, and regional nodes.” | To ensure financial autonomy and capacity |
| **Regional Nodes** | “INCHTMS shall establish and legally recognize subnational TIP coordination nodes in each wilaya (region). These nodes report to the national Secretariat and must follow standardized protocols.” | To extend reach beyond national capital and ensure local responsiveness |
| **Whistleblower Protection** | “Any member or employee may report obstruction, noncompliance, or corruption to a designated oversight body, immune from reprisal, with confidentiality guaranteed.” | To reduce sabotage or cover-ups |
| **Conflict of Interest** | “Members must disclose personal or institutional interests; recuse themselves from decision-making in matters where conflict arises.” | To maintain integrity and legitimacy |
| **Survivor Participation** | “INCHTMS shall include survivor representatives (rotating and protected) in advisory or decision-making committees, with trauma-informed safeguards and confidentiality protocols.” | To enhance legitimacy, voice, and rights-based approach |
| **Amendment Procedures** | “Bylaws may be amended by two-thirds majority in plenary, with at least one month’s notice; statutory amendments require parliamentary ratification.” | To define change paths and prevent ad hoc alterations |
| **Review & Evaluation Mandate** | “INCHTMS shall commission independent external reviews every 4–5 years and publish findings, including implementation gaps and recommendations.” | For accountability and continuous improvement |
| **Translation / Interpretation Clause** | “In all legal and investigative proceedings under TIP law, interpretation/translation services shall be guaranteed to victims or accused who do not understand the language of proceedings.” | To reduce procedural unfairness, especially for migrants |
| **Linkage with Migration & Detention SOPs** | “The law incorporates standard operating procedure protocols for migrant interception, disembarkation, and screening into TIP statute to ensure alignment across enforcement, humanitarian, and protection functions.” | To avoid legal gaps between TIP and migration enforcement |

**Implementation Strategy** for the proposed INCHTMS bylaws framework and complementary legal updates. I’ll move through **phases, actors, instruments, and risks/mitigation** so it’s operational and realistic for Mauritania’s context.

---

# **Implementation of the Proposed INCHTMS Framework**

### **Phase 1: Legal & Institutional Anchoring**

* **Action:** Secure formal adoption of bylaws by decree from the Ministry of Justice (or Presidential order) pending full parliamentary ratification.

* **Actors:** Ministry of Justice, INCHTMS Secretariat, Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee.

* **Outputs:**

  * Internal bylaws legally recognized as binding.

  * Independent budget line inserted in the 2026 Finance Law.

  * Mandate letters assigning ministries and NGOs to committees.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Political inertia → Engage high-level champions (Justice Minister, anti-slavery judges, diaspora advocates) to frame reforms as international credibility gains (TIP ranking improvement, donor confidence).

---

### **Phase 2: Institutional Design & Staffing**

* **Action:** Recruit and train Secretariat staff (legal, data, victim services, financial admin).

* **Actors:** Civil Service Commission, donor partners (IOM, UNODC), diaspora consultants.

* **Outputs:**

  * Operational Secretariat with dedicated office space and IT infrastructure.

  * Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for committees drafted and approved.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Capacity shortage → Use donor secondments and diaspora expertise to fill technical gaps until Mauritanian professionals are trained.

---

### **Phase 3: Committee Activation**

* **Action:** Convene and operationalize all six Standing Committees (Legal & Judicial, Victim Protection, Training, Data, Prevention, Donors).

* **Actors:** Committee chairs from ministries, civil society, INCHTMS Secretariat.

* **Outputs:**

  * First-year work plans with measurable KPIs (e.g., \# of prosecutions supported, \# of victims referred).

  * Integration with National Action Plan 2024–2026 targets.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Turf battles among ministries → Embed clear rules of procedure (bylaws) and give Chairperson power to escalate disputes.

---

### **Phase 4: Data & Transparency Systems**

* **Action:** Build a **central TIP Data Dashboard** with secure access for member ministries and NGOs.

* **Actors:** INCHTMS Data & Monitoring Committee, Ministry of Digital Transformation, donor-funded IT contractors.

* **Outputs:**

  * Quarterly national trafficking reports (cases investigated, prosecutions, victim referrals).

  * Disaggregated regional data to show hotspots and trends.

  * Public annual report \+ independent audit.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Data manipulation or underreporting → Independent audits and whistleblower protection clauses embedded in bylaws.

---

### **Phase 5: Regionalization & Localization**

* **Action:** Establish subnational INCHTMS committees in each wilaya, tied to governors and NGOs.

* **Actors:** Local governors, civil society, INCHTMS Secretariat, diaspora advisors.

* **Outputs:**

  * 13 regional nodes with reporting pipelines to central Secretariat.

  * Victim referral pathways mapped and tested at local level.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Weak regional buy-in → Use donor micro-grants and community dialogues to build legitimacy.

---

### **Phase 6: Prevention & Public Awareness**

* **Action:** Roll out targeted **national awareness campaigns** focusing on TIP risks, child labor, and migrant smuggling.

* **Actors:** Prevention Committee, NGOs, diaspora networks, Ministry of Information.

* **Outputs:**

  * Radio/TV campaigns in Hassaniya, Pulaar, Soninke, Wolof.

  * Diaspora outreach for remittances and safe migration advocacy.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Social resistance or denial → Partner with religious leaders and community elders to frame anti-trafficking as aligned with national values and Sharia principles.

---

### **Phase 7: International & Donor Engagement**

* **Action:** Sign **MoUs with IOM, UNODC, EU, USAID, AU** for technical and financial support.

* **Actors:** INCHTMS Secretariat, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

* **Outputs:**

  * Donor Coordination Committee operational.

  * Multi-year donor pledges aligned with NAP 2024–2026.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Donor fatigue → Demonstrate transparency with annual public reports, external audits, and survivor participation mechanisms.

---

### **Phase 8: Review & Continuous Improvement**

* **Action:** Institutionalize a 5-year review cycle with **external evaluation** of INCHTMS effectiveness.

* **Actors:** Independent evaluators (universities, UN experts), INCHTMS plenary.

* **Outputs:**

  * Reform recommendations published and debated in Parliament.

  * Bylaw amendments passed via two-thirds plenary vote.

* **Risks & Mitigation:** Complacency → Tie evaluations to donor funding disbursement to ensure follow-through.

# **Cross-Cutting Enablers**

1. **Capacity Building:** Embed continuous training (police, judges, NGOs, diaspora reps) via the Training Committee.

2. **Ethics & Safeguards:** Enforce whistleblower protections, conflict of interest rules, and survivor-centered practices at every level.

3. **Diaspora Engagement:** Formalize partnerships with diaspora organizations for intelligence-sharing, advocacy, and reintegration of survivors.

4. **Integration with Migration Policy:** Align INCHTMS work with asylum law development and migrant protection reforms (detention oversight, interpreters).

---

📌 **Bottom Line:**  
 Implementation hinges on **political will, donor partnership, and diaspora engagement**. Your framework provides the “missing operating system” between the 2020 law and the new reforms (courts, NAP). If sequenced through the phases above, Mauritania could **move from a reactive TIP posture to a proactive, rights-based, and internationally credible system**.
