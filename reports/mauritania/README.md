# **Policy Brief: Strengthening Mauritania's Anti-Trafficking Framework Through Institutional Reform**

### **1\. Introduction: The Gap Between Law and Practice**

Mauritania has made significant legislative achievements in combating human trafficking, most notably through its landmark 2015 anti-slavery law and the comprehensive 2020 anti-trafficking law. These legal instruments provide a strong foundation for prosecuting perpetrators and protecting victims. However, a critical gap persists between this legal framework and its effective implementation on the ground. Despite recent progress in enforcement and strategic planning, systemic operational deficiencies continue to undermine the state's response—reforms essential for bolstering the credibility of Mauritania's anti-trafficking efforts on the international stage. This brief analyzes these critical deficiencies in prosecution and victim protection and proposes targeted institutional reforms to empower Mauritania's national coordinating body, thereby closing the gap between legislative intent and practical reality.

### **2\. Mauritania's Evolving Anti-Trafficking Architecture: Progress and Commitments**

A comprehensive legal and institutional framework is the foundation of any credible national response to human trafficking. It signals political will, defines accountability, and establishes the non-negotiable architecture for state accountability and enables decisive action across the justice and social service sectors. Mauritania has invested significantly in building this architecture, establishing a modern legal basis and demonstrating a commitment to continued reform.

#### **Key Legislative Milestones**

* ***2015 Anti-Slavery Law:*** This foundational law criminalizes hereditary slavery, a deeply rooted practice, and prescribes stringent penalties of five to 20 years’ imprisonment for convicted traffickers.  
* ***2020 Anti-Trafficking Law (Act No. 2020-017):*** This act modernizes Mauritania's legal code by criminalizing both sex and labor trafficking with penalties of 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment. Crucially, it correctly classifies hereditary slavery as a form of human trafficking and established the national coordinating body, the *Instance Nationale de Coordination de la Lutte contre la Traite des Personnes et le Trafic Illicite de Migrants* (INCHTMS).

#### **Recent Positive Developments**

In the past year, the government has taken commendable steps to reinforce its commitments through tangible actions documented in the 2024 U.S. Trafficking in Persons Report and other official updates:

* **Judicial Reform:** A centralized special court was established in October 2024 to consolidate jurisdiction over all slavery and trafficking cases nationwide, aiming to streamline and strengthen judicial processes.  
* **Strategic Planning:** The government adopted the 2024-2026 National Action Plan (NAP) to provide an integrated roadmap for identification, protection, assistance, and prosecution efforts.  
* **Increased Enforcement:** Authorities increased the number of prosecutions and convictions under both the 2015 and 2020 laws, including a notable case against three Quranic teachers for the forced begging of children.  
* **Victim Support Initiatives:** Formal partnerships were established with civil society organizations to administer a dedicated victims' fund, providing direct support to survivors of hereditary slavery.

While these advancements are commendable, persistent operational gaps in enforcement and coordination prevent the full realization of the laws' objectives.

### **3\. Analysis of Critical Operational Gaps**

Despite a solid legal foundation, the effectiveness of Mauritania's anti-trafficking response is undermined by specific, recurring failures in the justice and protection systems. These deficiencies weaken the impact of new laws and leave vulnerable populations at risk. This section dissects these critical gaps.

#### **3.1. Gaps in Prosecution and Enforcement**

The investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes, particularly those related to hereditary slavery, remain inadequate. Reports indicate that some law enforcement and judicial officials refuse to investigate these crimes, while others encourage or facilitate settlements outside the formal justice system—a practice explicitly forbidden by the 2015 anti-slavery law. This challenge is compounded by significant concerns of corruption and official complicity, which actively inhibit law enforcement action. Furthermore, the anti-slavery court system continues to suffer from a lack of adequate resources, specialized prosecutors, and dedicated investigative magistrates, hampering its ability to deliver timely and effective justice.

#### **3.2. Deficiencies in Victim Protection and Referral**

Shortfalls in victim identification and support systems leave many victims unidentified and unprotected. Officials consistently fail to adequately screen vulnerable populations for trafficking indicators, including communities historically exploited in hereditary slavery, migrants, and domestic workers. The government’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM), designed to standardize victim identification and referral, was not yet operational at the end of the last reporting period. This has severe consequences, including the inappropriate penalization of victims; female victims of hereditary slavery and sex trafficking are sometimes prosecuted under fornication or adultery charges. Finally, the provision of shelter and services for adult victims is severely inadequate, with no specialized shelters available for adult male victims.

#### **3.3. Weaknesses in National Coordination Architecture**

The primary national coordinating body, INCHTMS, is a critical component of the national anti-trafficking architecture. However, its founding legislation contains several structural weaknesses that render it a coordinating body in name only, fundamentally constraining its authority and operational capacity:

* **Lack of Binding Authority:** The law does not explicitly grant INCHTMS the power to issue binding coordination directives to member ministries, reducing its role to one of voluntary cooperation rather than mandated compliance.  
* **No Financial Autonomy:** The law fails to provide for an independent budget line, making INCHTMS’s operations dependent on discretionary funding and limiting its ability to support regional activities or partner NGOs.  
* **Limited Inclusivity:** The legal framework does not formally define roles for key non-state stakeholders, such as civil society organizations (NGOs) or diaspora consultant networks, in its governance structure, limiting its access to frontline expertise.  
* **Absence of an Accountability Framework:** The law does not detail essential governance safeguards, such as whistleblower protections, conflict-of-interest rules, or mandatory review cycles, which are critical for transparency and effectiveness.

These identified gaps in prosecution, protection, and coordination necessitate targeted institutional reforms, particularly focused on empowering INCHTMS to lead the national response effectively.

### **4\. Strategic Recommendations for Institutional Strengthening**

Closing Mauritania's implementation gap hinges on transforming INCHTMS from a coordinating committee into an empowered national authority with the legal mandate and financial autonomy to drive the anti-trafficking agenda. The following recommendations provide a clear roadmap for this transformation through targeted legal and procedural amendments.

#### **Proposed Reforms to Empower INCHTMS**

| Area of Reform | Specific Recommendation | Source Law/Bylaw Article | Rationale / Intended Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Governance & Membership** | Formally include representatives from recognized NGOs, diaspora consultant networks, and survivors as core or advisory members. | Article II | Enhances legitimacy, incorporates frontline expertise, and ensures a victim-centered approach. |
| **Powers & Authority** | Amend Act No. 2020-017 or pass a decree to grant INCHTMS the authority to issue **binding coordination directives** to member agencies. | Article IV | Moves from voluntary coordination to mandated compliance, overcoming inter-ministerial inertia and non-compliance. |
| **Financial Autonomy** | Legislate an **independent budget line** for INCHTMS within the national budget to fund its secretariat, operations, and grants. | Article III | Ensures operational stability and the capacity to fund regional activities and support NGO partners without delay. |
| **Operational Structure** | Legally recognize and establish **subnational INCHTMS committees** in each wilaya (region) to localize coordination and victim referral. | Article V | Extends the national anti-trafficking response beyond the capital and ensures local realities inform policy. |
| **Ethical Safeguards** | Embed **legal whistleblower protections** for individuals reporting corruption or obstruction within the anti-trafficking system. | Article VI | Increases accountability and reduces the risk of official complicity or interference in trafficking cases. |

### **5\. Conclusion**

Mauritania has constructed a commendable legal framework to combat human trafficking and hereditary slavery, demonstrating a clear commitment to addressing these grave human rights violations. The critical next step is to match this legislative will with institutional power. The persistent gap between law and practice is not a failure of intent but of institutional capacity and authority. Empowering INCHTMS by granting it binding authority, financial autonomy, an inclusive structure, and robust accountability mechanisms is the most direct and effective path forward. This is not merely an administrative adjustment; it is a fundamental step toward aligning Mauritania's institutional practice with its legal commitments and international obligations. By implementing these reforms, Mauritania can ensure that the rights and protections guaranteed by its laws become a lived reality for all victims.

# **Action Plan: A Phased Strategy to Enhance Mauritania's National Anti-Trafficking Response**

## **1.0 Strategic Context and Imperative for Action**

This action plan presents a practical, goal-oriented roadmap for strengthening Mauritania’s response to human trafficking and hereditary slavery. According to the U.S. State Department's 2024 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, Mauritania maintains its Tier 2 status, reflecting a government that does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so. These efforts include prosecuting corrupt Quranic teachers under the 2020 law for the first time, adopting a new National Action Plan (NAP), and establishing formal partnerships with civil society to administer a dedicated victim support fund. However, persistent and critical gaps remain, including inadequate screening of vulnerable populations, systemic challenges in prosecuting hereditary slavery cases, and the continued penalization of trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their exploitation. This plan provides a cohesive framework for Mauritania's national coordinating committee (INCHTMS), its partner NGOs, and engaged diaspora networks to build a more effective national response.

The foundational legal framework for this work is well-established, principally through the 2015 anti-slavery law and the 2020 Law on the Prevention and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons. While these legal instruments provide the necessary authority to combat trafficking, the primary challenge lies in their consistent and effective implementation. This action plan is designed to address precisely that gap.

The following sections detail a structured, phased approach designed to transform policy into practice, beginning with foundational actions to strengthen coordination and progressing through targeted capacity building, victim-centered protection, and robust monitoring to ensure sustainable, measurable progress.

## **2.0 Phase 1: Foundational Actions \- Strengthening Coordination and Assessment**

A robust, empowered national coordinating body and a clear, data-informed understanding of the trafficking landscape are non-negotiable prerequisites for any successful national effort. Without a functional governance structure and a detailed assessment of specific risks and vulnerabilities, subsequent interventions risk being fragmented, inefficient, and ineffective. This foundational phase establishes the institutional and analytical bedrock upon which all other actions will be built.

### **Action Item 2.1: Fully Operationalize the INCHTMS Governance Structure**

The Instance Nationale de Coordination de la Lutte contre la Traite des Personnes et le Trafic Illicite de Migrants (INCHTMS) must be empowered with a clear, multi-sectoral governance structure to effectively lead the national response. Based on the *Recommended Draft Bylaws for INCHTMS*, this structure should include:

* **Leadership:** A high-level Chair, held by the Minister of Justice, and a Vice-Chair to ensure consistent leadership and political will.  
* **Permanent Secretariat:** A dedicated, day-to-day operational hub led by an Executive Secretary with technical staff focused on legal affairs, data management, victim services, and training.  
* **Multi-Sectoral Membership:** Formal inclusion of core government ministries (Justice, Interior, Social Affairs, etc.), key law enforcement bodies, and crucially, designated representatives from civil society organizations (e.g., SOS Esclaves, IRA) and Diaspora Consultant Networks.  
* **Advisory Observers:** A formal mechanism to include international partners like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in an advisory capacity to leverage their technical expertise and resources.

### **Action Item 2.2: Establish and Mandate INCHTMS Standing Committees**

To ensure focused and expert-driven work, INCHTMS will establish six Standing Committees, each with a clear mandate to drive progress in a key thematic area.

| Committee | Core Mandate |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Legal & Judicial Committee** | Reviews and harmonizes national legislation with international standards (e.g., Palermo Protocol) and provides targeted support to the anti-slavery courts. |
| **Victim Protection & Referral Committee** | Oversees the implementation of the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), ensures compliance, and coordinates the provision of shelter and psychosocial aid. |
| **Training & Capacity Building Committee** | Develops and certifies standardized training curricula for police, prosecutors, judges, social workers, and NGO partners. |
| **Data & Monitoring Committee** | Manages the centralized national trafficking database, analyzes trends, and publishes quarterly and annual progress reports. |
| **Prevention & Awareness Committee** | Coordinates national awareness campaigns, including targeted outreach to vulnerable communities and engagement with diaspora networks. |
| **Donor Coordination & Resource Committee** | Manages engagement with international donors, ensures the transparent allocation of the national budget, and oversees grants to NGOs. |

### **Action Item 2.3: Conduct Comprehensive Risk and Vulnerability Mapping**

A national strategy must be informed by a precise understanding of where and how trafficking occurs. INCHTMS will lead a comprehensive mapping exercise, synthesizing data from existing reports to identify key trafficking vectors and primary vulnerable populations.

#### **Key Trafficking Vectors**

* **Descent-Based Slavery:** Enduring practices of hereditary slavery, primarily affecting Haratin and Afro-Mauritanian communities, who are forced into domestic servitude and cattle herding.  
* **Forced Begging:** The exploitation of children, including Mauritanian and West African boys in some Quranic schools (*mahadras*), who are forced to beg for money and food.  
* **Labor Exploitation:** Forced labor in key informal sectors, including domestic work, fisheries, mining, and construction, often facilitated by unscrupulous subcontracting agencies known as *tacherons*.  
* **Sex Trafficking:** The exploitation of women and girls, particularly from vulnerable communities and migrant populations, in commercial sex.

#### **Primary Vulnerable Populations**

* **Haratin and Afro-Mauritanian Communities:** Subject to systemic discrimination and the persistence of ancestral master-slave relationships. It is especially difficult for children of Haratine and Afro-Mauritanian descent to obtain birth certificates, resulting in their denial of services and education, which critically increases their vulnerability to trafficking.  
* **Malian Refugees:** A large and growing population of over 170,000 Malian refugees facing economic hardship and limited opportunities, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation.  
* **Children in Mahadras:** Boys sent to Quranic schools who are exploited by corrupt teachers for forced begging.  
* **Women in Informal Sectors:** Women and girls, particularly from marginalized communities, lacking legal protections and economic alternatives, who are vulnerable to domestic servitude and sexual exploitation.  
* **Migrants in Transit Corridors:** Sub-Saharan African migrants transiting through Mauritania, especially in the port city of Nouadhibou, who are exploited by traffickers posing as smugglers.

This detailed assessment provides the evidence base required to build targeted capabilities that directly address Mauritania's specific trafficking challenges.

## **3.0 Phase 2: Capacity Building and Legal Enforcement**

A robust legal framework is merely symbolic without a justice sector capable of and committed to its enforcement. This phase directly addresses the critical implementation gap by building the institutional muscle and integrity required to dismantle impunity, particularly concerning official complicity and the illegal circumvention of justice in slavery cases.

### **Action Item 3.1: Launch Standardized, Multi-Lingual Training Modules**

INCHTMS will develop and deploy a nationwide, standardized training program to ensure all relevant actors have a common understanding of trafficking crimes and victim-centered procedures. Key features of this program include:

* **Target Audiences:** Comprehensive training for police, gendarmerie, border patrol, prosecutors, officials of the anti-slavery courts, social workers, and civil society monitors.  
* **Languages:** To ensure accessibility and effectiveness across the country, all training modules and materials must be available in Arabic, French, and Pulaar.  
* **Core Curriculum:** The standardized curriculum will cover essential topics, including:  
  * The 2015 anti-slavery law and the 2020 anti-trafficking law.  
  * Mauritanian anti-slavery jurisprudence and evidence standards.  
  * Victim-centered and trauma-informed investigation techniques.  
  * Standard operating procedures for the National Referral Mechanism (NRM).

### **Action Item 3.2: Strengthen Prosecution and Judicial Integrity**

To address persistent shortcomings in the justice system and overcome official obstruction, the Ministry of Justice must take the following prioritized actions:

1. **Resource the Anti-Slavery Courts:** Provide the centralized special court structure with adequate financial resources and, critically, dedicated and specialized prosecutors and judges to effectively adjudicate hereditary slavery and trafficking cases from across the country.  
2. **Eliminate Extra-Judicial Settlements:** Issue a clear directive and enforce the law that strictly forbids the settlement of hereditary slavery cases, ensuring perpetrators face criminal penalties as mandated by law rather than being permitted to resolve felony crimes through illegal financial settlements.  
3. **Investigate Official Complicity:** Mandate the rigorous investigation and prosecution of any law enforcement or judicial officials who refuse to investigate hereditary slavery crimes, encourage victims to withdraw complaints, or otherwise collude with traffickers.  
4. **Enforce Restitution Orders:** Establish a functional mechanism to track and enforce court-ordered restitution payments, ensuring that financial compensation awarded to victims is consistently paid by convicted traffickers.

Effective prosecution cannot succeed in a vacuum; it must be paired with comprehensive, non-punitive support for the victims at the center of these cases.

## **4.0 Phase 3: Victim-Centered Protection and Support**

An effective anti-trafficking strategy must be built around a victim-centered approach. Protecting survivors is not merely a humanitarian obligation; it is a critical component of successful prosecutions and a fundamental requirement for breaking cycles of exploitation. As noted in the 2024 TIP Report, the fear of being penalized for acts like "fornication" or "adultery" actively deters victims from coming forward, perpetuating impunity for traffickers. This phase focuses on building a robust, non-punitive system of care for all victims.

### **Action Item 4.1: Achieve Full Implementation of the National Referral Mechanism (NRM)**

As a top-priority action, the finalized National Referral Mechanism (NRM) must be made fully operational. INCHTMS will mandate the use of the NRM for all frontline actors—including police, border guards, and social workers—to ensure the standardized, proactive identification and referral of all potential trafficking victims to appropriate care, eliminating ad-hoc responses.

### **Action Item 4.2: Expand and Diversify Victim Support Services**

To meet the diverse needs of survivors, the government and its civil society partners must significantly expand the availability and quality of victim services. Key actions include:

* **Scale the Victim Fund:** Build on the success of the INCHTMS victim fund (currently allocated 8.1 million MRU, approx. $206,845) by increasing its budget and expanding partnerships with NGOs to serve a significantly higher number of survivors beyond the current 50 beneficiaries.  
* **Increase Shelter Capacity:** Urgently address the severe inadequacy of shelter for adult victims of trafficking, which includes the complete lack of any dedicated shelter facilities for adult male victims.  
* **Provide Comprehensive Aid:** Ensure survivors have access to a full suite of essential services, including specialized legal aid, medical and psychosocial support, assistance with obtaining civil registration and identity documents, and access to income-generating activities to foster long-term self-sufficiency.  
* **Repeal Punitive Laws:** Formally recommend and advocate for the repeal of laws that allow for the prosecution of victims of sexual violence and trafficking for crimes such as adultery or fornication, thereby removing a major barrier to victims seeking justice.

### **Action Item 4.3: Establish a Formal Victim-Witness Assistance Program**

A formal victim-witness assistance program must be implemented to ensure victims can safely participate in the criminal justice process. This is essential to counteract current practices where, as observers report, victims and accused traffickers are often brought together during interviews, placing enormous pressure on victims to change their testimony. The program will include:

* Robust measures to protect victims and their families from intimidation or retaliation by traffickers.  
* Logistical and financial support to cover the costs of travel and lodging for victims and witnesses attending court proceedings.  
* Mandatory use of victim-centered, trauma-informed approaches during all interviews and court proceedings to prevent re-traumatization.

Ultimately, a victim-centered system is only sustainable if its performance is rigorously tracked, ensuring that these protective measures translate into measurable justice and systemic change, which is the focus of our final phase.

## **5.0 Phase 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Prevention**

A robust monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) framework is essential for transforming intent into impact. Without verifiable data and transparent reporting, it is impossible to measure progress, ensure accountability among agencies, and adapt strategies effectively. This phase institutionalizes a data-driven approach to governance and complements it with targeted prevention campaigns designed to address the root causes of vulnerability.

### **Action Item 5.1: Develop and Deploy a National TIP Watch Dashboard**

A centralized data dashboard, managed by the INCHTMS Data & Monitoring Committee, will be created to serve as the central accountability instrument for the national response. This dashboard must track key, disaggregated data points, including:

* Case reporting statistics, disaggregated by region, to identify geographic hotspots.  
* Victim identification and referral outcomes through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM).  
* Prosecution and conviction rates under both the 2015 anti-slavery and 2020 anti-trafficking laws.  
* Budget allocations and resource tracking for the anti-slavery courts and government-funded victim services.

### **Action Item 5.2: Institute Accountability and Transparency Mechanisms**

To build public trust and ensure institutional commitment, the following accountability procedures will be implemented:

* **Quarterly Diaspora-Led Audits:** INCHTMS will partner with civil society organizations and diaspora consultant networks to conduct regular, independent audits of anti-trafficking activities and outcomes.  
* **Mandatory Public Reporting:** INCHTMS will be required to publish a comprehensive annual public report detailing its activities, data from the TIP Watch Dashboard, and progress against the National Action Plan.

### **Action Item 5.3: Sustain and Target National Prevention Campaigns**

Building on ongoing awareness campaigns, INCHTMS will scale and refine prevention efforts by:

* Using the risk and vulnerability mapping data from Phase 1 to design and target campaigns at specific vulnerable groups (e.g., communities affected by hereditary slavery, children in Quranic schools) and in geographic hotspots.  
* Expanding the use and promotion of national hotlines, such as the one jointly operated by INCHTMS and an NGO, to serve as safe, accessible, and confidential channels for reporting trafficking crimes.

The successful execution of this four-phase plan is contingent upon the clear assignment of roles to the key actors responsible for its implementation.

## **6.0 Delineation of Roles and Responsibilities**

The success of this comprehensive action plan depends on clear ownership and seamless collaboration among all key government, civil society, and international stakeholders. Each entity has a distinct and vital role to play in transforming this strategy into a functional and effective national system.

| Stakeholder | Primary Role | Key Responsibilities |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **INCHTMS** | Lead National Coordinator | Oversee implementation of the National Action Plan; ensure effective inter-agency coordination; manage the national TIP data dashboard; lead national and international reporting. |
| **Ministry of Justice** | Judicial and Legal Lead | Provide oversight of the centralized anti-slavery court; develop and deliver training for prosecutors and judges; serve as the central authority for international judicial cooperation. |
| **Mauritanian NGOs (e.g., SOS Esclaves, IRA)** | Frontline Service Delivery and Advocacy | Provide direct case support and aid to survivors; conduct community outreach and awareness; identify and report cases of hereditary slavery; advocate for policy reform. |
| **Diaspora Consultant Network** | Technical and Financial Catalyst | Deliver specialized training and technical guidance; provide grant writing support to local NGOs; assist with fundraising and international advocacy efforts. |
| **International Donors (e.g., USAID, EU, UNODC)** | Resource and M\&E Partner | Provide financial and technical resources for program implementation; support program design aligned with international standards; conduct third-party monitoring and evaluation. |

## **7.0 Key Metrics for Measuring Success**

Progress against this action plan will be measured against a set of clear, quantitative, and qualitative indicators designed to track meaningful change. These Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will form the basis for all monitoring, evaluation, and public reporting activities.

* **Prosecution:** A sustained, year-over-year increase in trafficking convictions secured under the 2015 and 2020 laws, with perpetrators receiving significant prison terms that serve as a credible deterrent.  
* **Victim Identification:** A verifiable increase in the number of trafficking victims formally identified and referred to appropriate care through the fully operational National Referral Mechanism (NRM).  
* **Hereditary Slavery:** A tangible increase in the percentage of reported hereditary slavery cases that are officially investigated and referred to the specialized anti-slavery courts, with a corresponding, measurable decrease in cases resolved through illegal extra-judicial settlements.  
* **Capacity Building:** The total number of police officers, judicial officials, and social workers who have completed and been certified on the standardized training modules covering the anti-trafficking legal framework and NRM protocols.  
* **Resource Allocation:** A measurable year-over-year increase in the national budget allocated to INCHTMS, the anti-slavery courts, and the national victim support fund, demonstrating sustained government commitment.
