# **Policy Brief: Strengthening Mauritania's Anti-Trafficking Framework Through Institutional Reform**

### **1\. Introduction: The Gap Between Law and Practice**

Mauritania has made significant legislative achievements in combating human trafficking, most notably through its landmark 2015 anti-slavery law and the comprehensive 2020 anti-trafficking law. These legal instruments provide a strong foundation for prosecuting perpetrators and protecting victims. However, a critical gap persists between this legal framework and its effective implementation on the ground. Despite recent progress in enforcement and strategic planning, systemic operational deficiencies continue to undermine the state's response—reforms essential for bolstering the credibility of Mauritania's anti-trafficking efforts on the international stage. This brief analyzes these critical deficiencies in prosecution and victim protection and proposes targeted institutional reforms to empower Mauritania's national coordinating body, thereby closing the gap between legislative intent and practical reality.

### **2\. Mauritania's Evolving Anti-Trafficking Architecture: Progress and Commitments**

A comprehensive legal and institutional framework is the foundation of any credible national response to human trafficking. It signals political will, defines accountability, and establishes the non-negotiable architecture for state accountability and enables decisive action across the justice and social service sectors. Mauritania has invested significantly in building this architecture, establishing a modern legal basis and demonstrating a commitment to continued reform.

#### **Key Legislative Milestones**

* ***2015 Anti-Slavery Law:*** This foundational law criminalizes hereditary slavery, a deeply rooted practice, and prescribes stringent penalties of five to 20 years’ imprisonment for convicted traffickers.  
* ***2020 Anti-Trafficking Law (Act No. 2020-017):*** This act modernizes Mauritania's legal code by criminalizing both sex and labor trafficking with penalties of 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment. Crucially, it correctly classifies hereditary slavery as a form of human trafficking and established the national coordinating body, the *Instance Nationale de Coordination de la Lutte contre la Traite des Personnes et le Trafic Illicite de Migrants* (INCHTMS).

#### **Recent Positive Developments**

In the past year, the government has taken commendable steps to reinforce its commitments through tangible actions documented in the 2024 U.S. Trafficking in Persons Report and other official updates:

* **Judicial Reform:** A centralized special court was established in October 2024 to consolidate jurisdiction over all slavery and trafficking cases nationwide, aiming to streamline and strengthen judicial processes.  
* **Strategic Planning:** The government adopted the 2024-2026 National Action Plan (NAP) to provide an integrated roadmap for identification, protection, assistance, and prosecution efforts.  
* **Increased Enforcement:** Authorities increased the number of prosecutions and convictions under both the 2015 and 2020 laws, including a notable case against three Quranic teachers for the forced begging of children.  
* **Victim Support Initiatives:** Formal partnerships were established with civil society organizations to administer a dedicated victims' fund, providing direct support to survivors of hereditary slavery.

While these advancements are commendable, persistent operational gaps in enforcement and coordination prevent the full realization of the laws' objectives.

### **3\. Analysis of Critical Operational Gaps**

Despite a solid legal foundation, the effectiveness of Mauritania's anti-trafficking response is undermined by specific, recurring failures in the justice and protection systems. These deficiencies weaken the impact of new laws and leave vulnerable populations at risk. This section dissects these critical gaps.

#### **3.1. Gaps in Prosecution and Enforcement**

The investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes, particularly those related to hereditary slavery, remain inadequate. Reports indicate that some law enforcement and judicial officials refuse to investigate these crimes, while others encourage or facilitate settlements outside the formal justice system—a practice explicitly forbidden by the 2015 anti-slavery law. This challenge is compounded by significant concerns of corruption and official complicity, which actively inhibit law enforcement action. Furthermore, the anti-slavery court system continues to suffer from a lack of adequate resources, specialized prosecutors, and dedicated investigative magistrates, hampering its ability to deliver timely and effective justice.

#### **3.2. Deficiencies in Victim Protection and Referral**

Shortfalls in victim identification and support systems leave many victims unidentified and unprotected. Officials consistently fail to adequately screen vulnerable populations for trafficking indicators, including communities historically exploited in hereditary slavery, migrants, and domestic workers. The government’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM), designed to standardize victim identification and referral, was not yet operational at the end of the last reporting period. This has severe consequences, including the inappropriate penalization of victims; female victims of hereditary slavery and sex trafficking are sometimes prosecuted under fornication or adultery charges. Finally, the provision of shelter and services for adult victims is severely inadequate, with no specialized shelters available for adult male victims.

#### **3.3. Weaknesses in National Coordination Architecture**

The primary national coordinating body, INCHTMS, is a critical component of the national anti-trafficking architecture. However, its founding legislation contains several structural weaknesses that render it a coordinating body in name only, fundamentally constraining its authority and operational capacity:

* **Lack of Binding Authority:** The law does not explicitly grant INCHTMS the power to issue binding coordination directives to member ministries, reducing its role to one of voluntary cooperation rather than mandated compliance.  
* **No Financial Autonomy:** The law fails to provide for an independent budget line, making INCHTMS’s operations dependent on discretionary funding and limiting its ability to support regional activities or partner NGOs.  
* **Limited Inclusivity:** The legal framework does not formally define roles for key non-state stakeholders, such as civil society organizations (NGOs) or diaspora consultant networks, in its governance structure, limiting its access to frontline expertise.  
* **Absence of an Accountability Framework:** The law does not detail essential governance safeguards, such as whistleblower protections, conflict-of-interest rules, or mandatory review cycles, which are critical for transparency and effectiveness.

These identified gaps in prosecution, protection, and coordination necessitate targeted institutional reforms, particularly focused on empowering INCHTMS to lead the national response effectively.

### **4\. Strategic Recommendations for Institutional Strengthening**

Closing Mauritania's implementation gap hinges on transforming INCHTMS from a coordinating committee into an empowered national authority with the legal mandate and financial autonomy to drive the anti-trafficking agenda. The following recommendations provide a clear roadmap for this transformation through targeted legal and procedural amendments.

#### **Proposed Reforms to Empower INCHTMS**

| Area of Reform | Specific Recommendation | Source Law/Bylaw Article | Rationale / Intended Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Governance & Membership** | Formally include representatives from recognized NGOs, diaspora consultant networks, and survivors as core or advisory members. | Article II | Enhances legitimacy, incorporates frontline expertise, and ensures a victim-centered approach. |
| **Powers & Authority** | Amend Act No. 2020-017 or pass a decree to grant INCHTMS the authority to issue **binding coordination directives** to member agencies. | Article IV | Moves from voluntary coordination to mandated compliance, overcoming inter-ministerial inertia and non-compliance. |
| **Financial Autonomy** | Legislate an **independent budget line** for INCHTMS within the national budget to fund its secretariat, operations, and grants. | Article III | Ensures operational stability and the capacity to fund regional activities and support NGO partners without delay. |
| **Operational Structure** | Legally recognize and establish **subnational INCHTMS committees** in each wilaya (region) to localize coordination and victim referral. | Article V | Extends the national anti-trafficking response beyond the capital and ensures local realities inform policy. |
| **Ethical Safeguards** | Embed **legal whistleblower protections** for individuals reporting corruption or obstruction within the anti-trafficking system. | Article VI | Increases accountability and reduces the risk of official complicity or interference in trafficking cases. |

### **5\. Conclusion**

Mauritania has constructed a commendable legal framework to combat human trafficking and hereditary slavery, demonstrating a clear commitment to addressing these grave human rights violations. The critical next step is to match this legislative will with institutional power. The persistent gap between law and practice is not a failure of intent but of institutional capacity and authority. Empowering INCHTMS by granting it binding authority, financial autonomy, an inclusive structure, and robust accountability mechanisms is the most direct and effective path forward. This is not merely an administrative adjustment; it is a fundamental step toward aligning Mauritania's institutional practice with its legal commitments and international obligations. By implementing these reforms, Mauritania can ensure that the rights and protections guaranteed by its laws become a lived reality for all victims.

# **Action Plan: A Phased Strategy to Enhance Mauritania's National Anti-Trafficking Response**

## **1.0 Strategic Context and Imperative for Action**

This action plan presents a practical, goal-oriented roadmap for strengthening Mauritania’s response to human trafficking and hereditary slavery. According to the U.S. State Department's 2024 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, Mauritania maintains its Tier 2 status, reflecting a government that does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so. These efforts include prosecuting corrupt Quranic teachers under the 2020 law for the first time, adopting a new National Action Plan (NAP), and establishing formal partnerships with civil society to administer a dedicated victim support fund. However, persistent and critical gaps remain, including inadequate screening of vulnerable populations, systemic challenges in prosecuting hereditary slavery cases, and the continued penalization of trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their exploitation. This plan provides a cohesive framework for Mauritania's national coordinating committee (INCHTMS), its partner NGOs, and engaged diaspora networks to build a more effective national response.

The foundational legal framework for this work is well-established, principally through the 2015 anti-slavery law and the 2020 Law on the Prevention and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons. While these legal instruments provide the necessary authority to combat trafficking, the primary challenge lies in their consistent and effective implementation. This action plan is designed to address precisely that gap.

The following sections detail a structured, phased approach designed to transform policy into practice, beginning with foundational actions to strengthen coordination and progressing through targeted capacity building, victim-centered protection, and robust monitoring to ensure sustainable, measurable progress.

## **2.0 Phase 1: Foundational Actions \- Strengthening Coordination and Assessment**

A robust, empowered national coordinating body and a clear, data-informed understanding of the trafficking landscape are non-negotiable prerequisites for any successful national effort. Without a functional governance structure and a detailed assessment of specific risks and vulnerabilities, subsequent interventions risk being fragmented, inefficient, and ineffective. This foundational phase establishes the institutional and analytical bedrock upon which all other actions will be built.

### **Action Item 2.1: Fully Operationalize the INCHTMS Governance Structure**

The Instance Nationale de Coordination de la Lutte contre la Traite des Personnes et le Trafic Illicite de Migrants (INCHTMS) must be empowered with a clear, multi-sectoral governance structure to effectively lead the national response. Based on the *Recommended Draft Bylaws for INCHTMS*, this structure should include:

* **Leadership:** A high-level Chair, held by the Minister of Justice, and a Vice-Chair to ensure consistent leadership and political will.  
* **Permanent Secretariat:** A dedicated, day-to-day operational hub led by an Executive Secretary with technical staff focused on legal affairs, data management, victim services, and training.  
* **Multi-Sectoral Membership:** Formal inclusion of core government ministries (Justice, Interior, Social Affairs, etc.), key law enforcement bodies, and crucially, designated representatives from civil society organizations (e.g., SOS Esclaves, IRA) and Diaspora Consultant Networks.  
* **Advisory Observers:** A formal mechanism to include international partners like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in an advisory capacity to leverage their technical expertise and resources.

### **Action Item 2.2: Establish and Mandate INCHTMS Standing Committees**

To ensure focused and expert-driven work, INCHTMS will establish six Standing Committees, each with a clear mandate to drive progress in a key thematic area.

| Committee | Core Mandate |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Legal & Judicial Committee** | Reviews and harmonizes national legislation with international standards (e.g., Palermo Protocol) and provides targeted support to the anti-slavery courts. |
| **Victim Protection & Referral Committee** | Oversees the implementation of the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), ensures compliance, and coordinates the provision of shelter and psychosocial aid. |
| **Training & Capacity Building Committee** | Develops and certifies standardized training curricula for police, prosecutors, judges, social workers, and NGO partners. |
| **Data & Monitoring Committee** | Manages the centralized national trafficking database, analyzes trends, and publishes quarterly and annual progress reports. |
| **Prevention & Awareness Committee** | Coordinates national awareness campaigns, including targeted outreach to vulnerable communities and engagement with diaspora networks. |
| **Donor Coordination & Resource Committee** | Manages engagement with international donors, ensures the transparent allocation of the national budget, and oversees grants to NGOs. |

### **Action Item 2.3: Conduct Comprehensive Risk and Vulnerability Mapping**

A national strategy must be informed by a precise understanding of where and how trafficking occurs. INCHTMS will lead a comprehensive mapping exercise, synthesizing data from existing reports to identify key trafficking vectors and primary vulnerable populations.

#### **Key Trafficking Vectors**

* **Descent-Based Slavery:** Enduring practices of hereditary slavery, primarily affecting Haratin and Afro-Mauritanian communities, who are forced into domestic servitude and cattle herding.  
* **Forced Begging:** The exploitation of children, including Mauritanian and West African boys in some Quranic schools (*mahadras*), who are forced to beg for money and food.  
* **Labor Exploitation:** Forced labor in key informal sectors, including domestic work, fisheries, mining, and construction, often facilitated by unscrupulous subcontracting agencies known as *tacherons*.  
* **Sex Trafficking:** The exploitation of women and girls, particularly from vulnerable communities and migrant populations, in commercial sex.

#### **Primary Vulnerable Populations**

* **Haratin and Afro-Mauritanian Communities:** Subject to systemic discrimination and the persistence of ancestral master-slave relationships. It is especially difficult for children of Haratine and Afro-Mauritanian descent to obtain birth certificates, resulting in their denial of services and education, which critically increases their vulnerability to trafficking.  
* **Malian Refugees:** A large and growing population of over 170,000 Malian refugees facing economic hardship and limited opportunities, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation.  
* **Children in Mahadras:** Boys sent to Quranic schools who are exploited by corrupt teachers for forced begging.  
* **Women in Informal Sectors:** Women and girls, particularly from marginalized communities, lacking legal protections and economic alternatives, who are vulnerable to domestic servitude and sexual exploitation.  
* **Migrants in Transit Corridors:** Sub-Saharan African migrants transiting through Mauritania, especially in the port city of Nouadhibou, who are exploited by traffickers posing as smugglers.

This detailed assessment provides the evidence base required to build targeted capabilities that directly address Mauritania's specific trafficking challenges.

## **3.0 Phase 2: Capacity Building and Legal Enforcement**

A robust legal framework is merely symbolic without a justice sector capable of and committed to its enforcement. This phase directly addresses the critical implementation gap by building the institutional muscle and integrity required to dismantle impunity, particularly concerning official complicity and the illegal circumvention of justice in slavery cases.

### **Action Item 3.1: Launch Standardized, Multi-Lingual Training Modules**

INCHTMS will develop and deploy a nationwide, standardized training program to ensure all relevant actors have a common understanding of trafficking crimes and victim-centered procedures. Key features of this program include:

* **Target Audiences:** Comprehensive training for police, gendarmerie, border patrol, prosecutors, officials of the anti-slavery courts, social workers, and civil society monitors.  
* **Languages:** To ensure accessibility and effectiveness across the country, all training modules and materials must be available in Arabic, French, and Pulaar.  
* **Core Curriculum:** The standardized curriculum will cover essential topics, including:  
  * The 2015 anti-slavery law and the 2020 anti-trafficking law.  
  * Mauritanian anti-slavery jurisprudence and evidence standards.  
  * Victim-centered and trauma-informed investigation techniques.  
  * Standard operating procedures for the National Referral Mechanism (NRM).

### **Action Item 3.2: Strengthen Prosecution and Judicial Integrity**

To address persistent shortcomings in the justice system and overcome official obstruction, the Ministry of Justice must take the following prioritized actions:

1. **Resource the Anti-Slavery Courts:** Provide the centralized special court structure with adequate financial resources and, critically, dedicated and specialized prosecutors and judges to effectively adjudicate hereditary slavery and trafficking cases from across the country.  
2. **Eliminate Extra-Judicial Settlements:** Issue a clear directive and enforce the law that strictly forbids the settlement of hereditary slavery cases, ensuring perpetrators face criminal penalties as mandated by law rather than being permitted to resolve felony crimes through illegal financial settlements.  
3. **Investigate Official Complicity:** Mandate the rigorous investigation and prosecution of any law enforcement or judicial officials who refuse to investigate hereditary slavery crimes, encourage victims to withdraw complaints, or otherwise collude with traffickers.  
4. **Enforce Restitution Orders:** Establish a functional mechanism to track and enforce court-ordered restitution payments, ensuring that financial compensation awarded to victims is consistently paid by convicted traffickers.

Effective prosecution cannot succeed in a vacuum; it must be paired with comprehensive, non-punitive support for the victims at the center of these cases.

## **4.0 Phase 3: Victim-Centered Protection and Support**

An effective anti-trafficking strategy must be built around a victim-centered approach. Protecting survivors is not merely a humanitarian obligation; it is a critical component of successful prosecutions and a fundamental requirement for breaking cycles of exploitation. As noted in the 2024 TIP Report, the fear of being penalized for acts like "fornication" or "adultery" actively deters victims from coming forward, perpetuating impunity for traffickers. This phase focuses on building a robust, non-punitive system of care for all victims.

### **Action Item 4.1: Achieve Full Implementation of the National Referral Mechanism (NRM)**

As a top-priority action, the finalized National Referral Mechanism (NRM) must be made fully operational. INCHTMS will mandate the use of the NRM for all frontline actors—including police, border guards, and social workers—to ensure the standardized, proactive identification and referral of all potential trafficking victims to appropriate care, eliminating ad-hoc responses.

### **Action Item 4.2: Expand and Diversify Victim Support Services**

To meet the diverse needs of survivors, the government and its civil society partners must significantly expand the availability and quality of victim services. Key actions include:

* **Scale the Victim Fund:** Build on the success of the INCHTMS victim fund (currently allocated 8.1 million MRU, approx. $206,845) by increasing its budget and expanding partnerships with NGOs to serve a significantly higher number of survivors beyond the current 50 beneficiaries.  
* **Increase Shelter Capacity:** Urgently address the severe inadequacy of shelter for adult victims of trafficking, which includes the complete lack of any dedicated shelter facilities for adult male victims.  
* **Provide Comprehensive Aid:** Ensure survivors have access to a full suite of essential services, including specialized legal aid, medical and psychosocial support, assistance with obtaining civil registration and identity documents, and access to income-generating activities to foster long-term self-sufficiency.  
* **Repeal Punitive Laws:** Formally recommend and advocate for the repeal of laws that allow for the prosecution of victims of sexual violence and trafficking for crimes such as adultery or fornication, thereby removing a major barrier to victims seeking justice.

### **Action Item 4.3: Establish a Formal Victim-Witness Assistance Program**

A formal victim-witness assistance program must be implemented to ensure victims can safely participate in the criminal justice process. This is essential to counteract current practices where, as observers report, victims and accused traffickers are often brought together during interviews, placing enormous pressure on victims to change their testimony. The program will include:

* Robust measures to protect victims and their families from intimidation or retaliation by traffickers.  
* Logistical and financial support to cover the costs of travel and lodging for victims and witnesses attending court proceedings.  
* Mandatory use of victim-centered, trauma-informed approaches during all interviews and court proceedings to prevent re-traumatization.

Ultimately, a victim-centered system is only sustainable if its performance is rigorously tracked, ensuring that these protective measures translate into measurable justice and systemic change, which is the focus of our final phase.

## **5.0 Phase 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Prevention**

A robust monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) framework is essential for transforming intent into impact. Without verifiable data and transparent reporting, it is impossible to measure progress, ensure accountability among agencies, and adapt strategies effectively. This phase institutionalizes a data-driven approach to governance and complements it with targeted prevention campaigns designed to address the root causes of vulnerability.

### **Action Item 5.1: Develop and Deploy a National TIP Watch Dashboard**

A centralized data dashboard, managed by the INCHTMS Data & Monitoring Committee, will be created to serve as the central accountability instrument for the national response. This dashboard must track key, disaggregated data points, including:

* Case reporting statistics, disaggregated by region, to identify geographic hotspots.  
* Victim identification and referral outcomes through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM).  
* Prosecution and conviction rates under both the 2015 anti-slavery and 2020 anti-trafficking laws.  
* Budget allocations and resource tracking for the anti-slavery courts and government-funded victim services.

### **Action Item 5.2: Institute Accountability and Transparency Mechanisms**

To build public trust and ensure institutional commitment, the following accountability procedures will be implemented:

* **Quarterly Diaspora-Led Audits:** INCHTMS will partner with civil society organizations and diaspora consultant networks to conduct regular, independent audits of anti-trafficking activities and outcomes.  
* **Mandatory Public Reporting:** INCHTMS will be required to publish a comprehensive annual public report detailing its activities, data from the TIP Watch Dashboard, and progress against the National Action Plan.

### **Action Item 5.3: Sustain and Target National Prevention Campaigns**

Building on ongoing awareness campaigns, INCHTMS will scale and refine prevention efforts by:

* Using the risk and vulnerability mapping data from Phase 1 to design and target campaigns at specific vulnerable groups (e.g., communities affected by hereditary slavery, children in Quranic schools) and in geographic hotspots.  
* Expanding the use and promotion of national hotlines, such as the one jointly operated by INCHTMS and an NGO, to serve as safe, accessible, and confidential channels for reporting trafficking crimes.

The successful execution of this four-phase plan is contingent upon the clear assignment of roles to the key actors responsible for its implementation.

## **6.0 Delineation of Roles and Responsibilities**

The success of this comprehensive action plan depends on clear ownership and seamless collaboration among all key government, civil society, and international stakeholders. Each entity has a distinct and vital role to play in transforming this strategy into a functional and effective national system.

| Stakeholder | Primary Role | Key Responsibilities |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **INCHTMS** | Lead National Coordinator | Oversee implementation of the National Action Plan; ensure effective inter-agency coordination; manage the national TIP data dashboard; lead national and international reporting. |
| **Ministry of Justice** | Judicial and Legal Lead | Provide oversight of the centralized anti-slavery court; develop and deliver training for prosecutors and judges; serve as the central authority for international judicial cooperation. |
| **Mauritanian NGOs (e.g., SOS Esclaves, IRA)** | Frontline Service Delivery and Advocacy | Provide direct case support and aid to survivors; conduct community outreach and awareness; identify and report cases of hereditary slavery; advocate for policy reform. |
| **Diaspora Consultant Network** | Technical and Financial Catalyst | Deliver specialized training and technical guidance; provide grant writing support to local NGOs; assist with fundraising and international advocacy efforts. |
| **International Donors (e.g., USAID, EU, UNODC)** | Resource and M\&E Partner | Provide financial and technical resources for program implementation; support program design aligned with international standards; conduct third-party monitoring and evaluation. |

## **7.0 Key Metrics for Measuring Success**

Progress against this action plan will be measured against a set of clear, quantitative, and qualitative indicators designed to track meaningful change. These Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will form the basis for all monitoring, evaluation, and public reporting activities.

* **Prosecution:** A sustained, year-over-year increase in trafficking convictions secured under the 2015 and 2020 laws, with perpetrators receiving significant prison terms that serve as a credible deterrent.  
* **Victim Identification:** A verifiable increase in the number of trafficking victims formally identified and referred to appropriate care through the fully operational National Referral Mechanism (NRM).  
* **Hereditary Slavery:** A tangible increase in the percentage of reported hereditary slavery cases that are officially investigated and referred to the specialized anti-slavery courts, with a corresponding, measurable decrease in cases resolved through illegal extra-judicial settlements.  
* **Capacity Building:** The total number of police officers, judicial officials, and social workers who have completed and been certified on the standardized training modules covering the anti-trafficking legal framework and NRM protocols.  
* **Resource Allocation:** A measurable year-over-year increase in the national budget allocated to INCHTMS, the anti-slavery courts, and the national victim support fund, demonstrating sustained government commitment.

# **QA-MNS Consulting: PESTELS and Socio-Cultural Analysis of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania**

## **I. Executive Summary: Strategic Context and Key Risk Synthesis**

The Islamic Republic of Mauritania presents a complex risk profile characterized by a fundamental dichotomy: externally approved fiscal stability contrasted with deep-seated internal socio-political fragility. Macroeconomic management, driven by cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB), has resulted in declining inflation, tight fiscal consolidation, and a moderate risk of debt distress, positioning the economy for projected medium-term growth.1 This stability, however, appears to be achieved through a governance model that suppresses civil liberties and structurally maintains profound social inequalities.

Mauritania’s stability is threatened by three major interlinked challenges:

1. **Structural Social Inequality:** The nation’s social contract is fundamentally compromised by deep stratification. The Haratin population, constituting 40% of the populace, faces persistent social, economic, and political exclusion rooted in descent-based slavery, which remains an enduring issue despite legal prohibitions.3 This systemic exclusion represents an internal fault line capable of undermining long-term political stability.  
2. **Repressive Governance:** While formal political structures exist, the regime employs overly broad, repressive legal mechanisms—including severe penalties for blasphemy and the spread of "false information"—to stifle dissent, prosecute human rights defenders, and control the flow of information.4 The consideration by the US Congress of the Mauritania TPS Act (H.R. 7034\) reflects an official external recognition of severe, destabilizing domestic conditions.6  
3. **Compounding External Stressors:** The country is highly vulnerable to environmental factors (aridity, desertification) which exacerbate food insecurity and internal migration. These challenges are amplified by an immense humanitarian burden, hosting approximately 170,000 Malian refugees and serving as a critical transit hub for 500,000 irregular migrants en route to Europe.2 This humanitarian load strains public services and contributes significantly to the elevated rates of violent crime observed in the capital.7

Strategic assessments must balance the opportunities arising from macroeconomic reforms and resource wealth against the high probability of socio-political shocks arising from structural inequality and environmental distress.

## **II. PESTELS Analysis of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania**

### **A. Political Environment (P)**

#### **1\. Government Structure, Stability, and Governance Issues**

Mauritania, officially *Al-Jumhūriyyah al-Islāmiyyah al-Mūrītāniyyah*, functions as an Islamic Republic.8 Executive power is held by the President, Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ghazouani, who is assisted by Prime Minister Mokhtar Ould Diay.8 The nation gained independence from France on November 28, 1960\.8

The legislative function is bicameral.9 The parliament consists of the higher house, the Majilis al-Shuyukh (Senate), which has 53 members elected by indirect vote and three reserved for the diaspora, serving six-year terms.9 The lower house, Jamiya Al Wataniya (National Assembly), has 81 members elected in single and multi-member constituencies and 14 members elected through a closed-list proportional representation system, serving five-year terms.9 The current government's policy framework, evolving into

*Mon ambition pour la nation*, is structured around five strategic pillars designed to guide national development: institutional governance, economic resilience, human capital development, social inclusion, and security.2 Specific commitments include combating corruption, empowering youth, and improving agriculture and education.2

#### **2\. The Governance Paradox: Fiscal Health vs. Political Repression**

Mauritania faces a fundamental contradiction in its governance model. On one hand, the government receives substantial approval from international financial institutions for its handling of economic affairs. The country has demonstrated sound macroeconomic management and a commitment to reform, which has strengthened debt sustainability and resilience to shocks.1 This success facilitates access to facilities like the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).1

However, this fiscal stabilization exists concurrently with severe political repression. The political system utilizes instruments of legal control to maintain power and suppress dissent. Repressive laws concerning criminal defamation, spreading "false information," cybercrime, and blasphemy are routinely employed to prosecute and jail human rights defenders, activists, journalists, and bloggers.4 An overly broad law stipulates harsh prison sentences and fines for the publication of "false news".5 Furthermore, security forces have used excessive force to disperse peaceful protests, violating fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and expression.4 The government’s strategic action appears to prioritize maintaining external fiscal legitimacy—which secures vital international loans and aid—over implementing genuine internal political liberalization and respecting civil rights. This approach significantly reduces immediate economic risk but simultaneously accumulates long-term sociopolitical instability, as stifled dissent creates a high potential for future, more disruptive political shocks that could unravel fiscal gains.

#### **3\. Relations with International Partners**

Engagement with partners, particularly the IMF and World Bank, is robust, as evidenced by multiple ongoing review processes for economic arrangements.1 Mauritania is also a vital partner in EU migration control strategies, acting as a crucial transit point for migrants en route to Europe.2 This role, while strategically important, has been criticized, with reports highlighting abuses associated with migration control.5 A major indicator of international concern is the introduction of the Mauritania TPS Act (H.R. 7034\) in the US Congress in January 2024\.6 This legislative action reflects official concern regarding severe, destabilizing conditions in the country, likely related to the endemic human rights violations, and creates diplomatic friction by publicly affirming that domestic conditions are unsafe for returning nationals.

### **B. Economic Environment (E)**

#### **1\. Macroeconomic Fundamentals and Key Sectors**

The Mauritanian economy has shown resilience but is subject to deceleration. Economic growth, estimated at 6.5% in 2023, declined to 5.1% in 2024 (per capita growth of 2.1%).2 Real GDP growth is projected to slow further to 4.4% in 2025\.1 Growth drivers include strong export performance and resilient private consumption, although these were partially offset by a slowdown in key extractive industries, specifically gold and iron ore production, and weaker public consumption.2

Inflation has been relatively well-managed, falling to 1.5% year-on-year in December 2024, down from 1.6% in 2023\. This drop is attributed to tight monetary policy implemented by the Central Bank and lower global prices for food and fuel.2 Consumer prices are projected to rise slightly to 3.5% in 2025\.1

Fiscal performance has been strong, with consolidation measures leading to a reduction in the budget deficit to 0.1% of GDP in 2024, a significant decrease from 2.4% in 2023\. This achievement was facilitated by increased revenues, particularly from telecommunications taxes and withholding taxes on extractive industries, alongside effective spending control.2 The debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to 44.5%, and the country is assessed to be at a moderate risk of debt distress.2

#### **2\. Sectoral Vulnerability and Future Growth Dependence**

While the financial metrics appear robust, the economy's dependence on primary sectors introduces significant vulnerability. The deceleration in GDP growth highlights the sensitivity of the national economy to commodity price volatility and production slowdowns in the mining sector (iron ore and gold).2 Furthermore, the IMF has explicitly recommended that the government focus on improving administration of hydrocarbon tax revenues.1 This emphasis suggests that future fiscal stability and continued debt reduction are highly contingent on the successful exploitation and management of emerging oil and gas resources. This transition trades volatility in existing mining commodities for long-term dependence risk inherent in a nascent resource economy lacking broad diversification.

The international institutions stress structural reform to achieve inclusive growth, recommending enhanced revenue mobilization and the strengthening of banking supervision.1 The World Bank's engagement highlights the critical importance of the livestock sector to poverty reduction, supporting resilience projects for agro-pastoral communities.2

Table 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators and Debt Profile

| Indicator | 2023 Actual | 2024 Estimate | 2025 Projected | Strategic Implication | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Real GDP Growth (%) | 6.5 | 5.1 | 4.4 | Decelerating growth requires urgent diversification. | 1 |
| Inflation (YoY %) | 1.6 | 1.5 (Dec 2024\) | 3.5 | Recent control via monetary policy, 2025 projection reflects external pressures. | 1 |
| Budget Deficit (% GDP) | 2.4 | 0.1 | N/A | Strong fiscal consolidation achieved through revenue enhancement. | 2 |
| Debt-to-GDP Ratio (%) | N/A | 44.5 | N/A | Moderate risk profile maintained, supported by IMF/WB oversight. | 2 |

#### **3\. Climate Change and Debt Interaction**

The country’s moderate risk of debt distress is inextricably linked to its extreme climate vulnerability. The IMF supports Mauritania through the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) for implementing adaptation and mitigation measures.1 This technical support acknowledges that the nation’s ability to manage its debt portfolio and fiscal stability depends heavily on its capacity to withstand climate shocks. Given that only 0.5% of the land is arable 2 and much of the economy relies on pastoralism and fishing (inferred from export strength), a severe drought or environmental failure could trigger massive humanitarian spending requirements. Such unplanned expenditure would immediately undermine fiscal discipline and push the debt risk profile toward a higher level of distress, demonstrating how environmental factors compound sovereign risk.

### **C. Social Environment (S)**

#### **1\. Social Stratification and The Exclusionary Threat**

Mauritania’s population is deeply stratified along ethnic and historical lines, which forms a significant barrier to achieving inclusive development. The population is divided into three primary ethnic groups 3:

* **Black Moors (Haratines):** Constituting 40% of the population, they are Arab-speaking but are descendants of slaves and former slaves of African origin, experiencing systemic political, social, and economic exclusion.3  
* **White Moors (Beydane):** Making up 30%, these are individuals of Arab-Berber descent who traditionally hold political and economic power.3  
* **Sub-Saharan Mauritanians:** Representing the remaining 30%, this group consists of non-Arabic speaking communities like the Halpulaar, Fulani, Soninke, and Wolof, many of whom reside in or originate from the Senegal River Valley.3

This pronounced structural inequality poses a severe long-term threat to internal stability. While the government identifies "social inclusion" as a strategic pillar 2, the failure to politically and economically integrate the largest demographic group (the Haratines) generates perpetual underlying conflict risk and inhibits equitable resource distribution.

#### **2\. Human Rights Conditions and Slavery Persistence**

The persistence of slavery is Mauritania’s most profound human rights concern. Despite multiple laws banning descent-based and modern forms of slavery and the establishment of specialized courts to prosecute perpetrators, the practice has not been eradicated.4 A UN Special Rapporteur report noted the continued exclusion faced by currently and formerly enslaved individuals and their descendants.4 Crucially, victims often lack knowledge of their fundamental rights or the established legal processes necessary for seeking redress, minimizing the effectiveness of existing anti-slavery legislation.4

Beyond slavery, severe restrictions on civil liberties are commonplace. The parliament has yet to pass a draft law on violence against women and girls introduced in 2016\.5 Furthermore, administrative obstacles, such as daunting civil registration requirements, prevent children from accessing education.5

#### **3\. Migration, Urbanization, and Security Overlap**

Mauritania is struggling under the weight of massive migratory pressures. More than half of the population (61.3%) lives in urban areas 2, a trend exacerbated by environmental pressures and conflict. The country hosts approximately 170,000 Malian refugees in the Mbera camp due to insecurity in Mali.2 Additionally, the capital, Nouakchott, serves as a crucial transit point for Europe-bound migrants, hosting an estimated 500,000 irregular migrants.2

This convergence of high urbanization and massive refugee/migrant influx strains public resources and social cohesion. This pressure directly feeds the domestic security challenges, contributing to the high rates of violent crime—including mugging, armed robbery, and assault—frequently observed outside the safer, wealthier neighborhoods of Nouakchott.7 The resulting resource strain complicates the government's ability to maintain public services and effective policing.

Table 2: Ethnic Stratification and Social Exclusion Fault Lines

| Ethnic Group | Approximate Population Share (%) | Linguistic Linkage | Socio-Economic Status/Exclusion | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Black Moors (Haratines) | 40% | Arabic (Hassaniya) | Face systemic exclusion; descendants of slaves; victims lack redress. | 3 |
| White Moors (Beydane) | 30% | Arabic (Hassaniya) | Traditionally dominant ruling/economic class. | 3 |
| Sub-Saharan Africans | 30% | Fula, Soninke, Wolof, Serer | Largely based in river valley; marginalized in urban economic life. | 3 |

### **D. Technological Environment (T)**

#### **1\. Infrastructure and Connectivity**

The technological environment is characterized by extremely high costs and low penetration. Mauritania holds the distinction of having some of the world's most expensive internet costs.10 Out of an estimated population of 4.7 million, only about 969,519 individuals have internet access, indicating penetration is around 20%.10 Low speeds and connectivity prices pose significant barriers to economic modernization and educational development.10

#### **2\. Technology in Governance and Research**

Despite connectivity challenges, there is a push for scientific advancement. Mauritania has established a National Research and Education Network (NREN), becoming the seventh African Arab country to do so.10 The NREN is intended to connect research institutions and universities nationally and regionally, providing access to essential educational resources.10

Paradoxically, the government employs technological tools for control. Mobile internet access has been shut down multiple times, both following political protests (such as the death of Oumar Diop) and, purportedly, to prevent cheating during high school exams.4 This practice reveals a governance structure that is willing to invest in controlled, high-value technological access for research but fears widespread, unregulated connectivity that could facilitate civil organization and dissent. The restrictive nature of internet access, whether due to high costs or state shutdowns, functions as a tool of social control that ultimately limits the broader societal benefits of technological adoption.

### **E. Environmental Environment (E)**

Mauritania is predominantly a desert country, with its relief and drainage profoundly influenced by aridity.8 The landscape is dominated by

*regs* (packed pebbles) and vast dune fields covering about half the national territory, with a climate defined by northeastern trade winds and the hot, dry *harmattan* wind.8 Arable land is acutely scarce, estimated at only 0.5% of the total land area.2

This geography makes the country highly susceptible to desertification, chronic drought, and water scarcity. These environmental factors are structural drivers of instability, forcing internal migration toward urban centers and eroding the resilience of pastoralist communities.2 The World Bank's Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS) is directly aimed at strengthening the resilience of (agro)pastoral communities, underscoring the vital, yet vulnerable, role of the livestock sector.2 International efforts, notably the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility, are essential for financing adaptation measures to mitigate these medium- to long-term challenges.1

### **F. Legal and Regulatory Environment (L)**

#### **1\. Systemic Failure in Human Rights Law**

The legal system formally operates under the 1991 constitution, which, while declaring Islam the official state religion, guarantees religious liberty.8 However, the rule of law is inconsistently applied, particularly concerning human rights and civil liberties.

The most egregious failure is the non-enforcement of anti-slavery laws. Despite the establishment of laws and specialized courts to prosecute slavery, the descent-based practice persists, and victims struggle to access justice.4 This systemic legal bias ensures that the judiciary protects the established power structure and ideology rather than enforcing equitable development goals promoted by external partners.2

Furthermore, the state uses highly repressive laws to suppress political speech. Laws related to criminal defamation, cybercrime, and the capital crime of blasphemy against the prophet are weaponized against government critics.4 A notable recent case involved a 19-year-old student who was detained for "insulting and backbiting the prophet" on a baccalaureate exam, facing a possible death sentence.4

#### **2\. Significance of the Mauritania TPS Act (H.R. 7034\)**

The legislative proposal, H.R. 7034, known as the Mauritania TPS Act of 2024, was introduced in the US House of Representatives on January 18, 2024\.6 The bill proposes designating Mauritania for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for an initial 18-month period.6

A TPS designation is reserved for countries facing conditions such as ongoing conflict or extraordinary circumstances that render the return of nationals unsafe. The introduction of this bill is significant because it represents an external diplomatic assessment by a major global power, legally affirming that the state of human rights and security in Mauritania—particularly the persistence of slavery and systematic violence—constitutes a grave, destabilizing crisis.6 This public acknowledgment directly contradicts the government's efforts to portray an image of increasing stability and good governance and holds potential negative implications for its relationships with countries relying on Mauritania for migration control.

### **G. Security Environment (S)**

Mauritania faces a complex, two-tiered security threat combining localized high-frequency violent crime with persistent regional terrorism.

#### **1\. Internal Conflict and Law Enforcement Capacity**

Internal security is challenged by high rates of violent crime, including assault, mugging, and armed robbery, which frequently occur outside the most affluent neighborhoods of Nouakchott.7 Local law enforcement possesses limited resources and often cannot respond effectively or rapidly to serious criminal incidents.7 The high volume of irregular migrants and refugees in urban centers, combined with structural poverty and unemployment, fuels this domestic crime threat.2

#### **2\. Regional and External Security Threats**

The country is situated on the volatile boundary between the Sahel and the Maghrib, making it susceptible to regional instability. Terrorism is a constant threat, with attacks potentially occurring with little or no warning and specifically targeting locations frequented by Western expatriates.7 Consequently, the US Department of State has designated certain areas as "Level 4: Do Not Travel" zones.7

This security environment introduces a structural strain on fiscal resources, which must be diverted to both domestic policing (to address urban violent crime) and international counter-terrorism efforts (to protect borders and critical infrastructure). The high-risk environment and limited infrastructure outside the capital deter Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and hinder technical assistance projects, especially those requiring access to remote, resource-rich areas.7

Table 3: Critical Governance and Security Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Area | Key Concern | Impact Type | Source Context | Strategic Significance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Slavery/Discrimination | Persistence of descent-based slavery and systemic exclusion of Haratines. | Social/Legal | Despite laws, victims lack information on rights/redress. | Deep structural inequality undermining WB inclusion efforts. |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| Rule of Law (Civil Liberties) | Use of blasphemy (death penalty risk) and false news laws against dissent. | Political/Legal | Jailing of activists; internet shutdowns during protests/exams. | Undermines democratic appearance and foreign confidence in governance. |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| Regional Security | High violent crime in cities, combined with regional terrorism targeting Westerners. | Security/Economic | Police lack resources; Level 4 travel advisories for specific areas. | Increases operational costs for investors and strains fiscal security budget. |
| 7 |  |  |  |  |
| Migration Policy (US) | H.R. 7034 introduced to designate Mauritania for Temporary Protected Status. | Political/Diplomatic | Signals official US concern over severe, destabilizing domestic conditions. | High risk indicator validating human rights groups’ findings. |

## **III. Cultural, Linguistic, and Demographic Norms Breakdown**

### **A. Demographic Profile**

Mauritania’s population is estimated at 4.629 million 1, making it one of the least densely populated countries globally.2 However, the country has undergone a rapid demographic shift toward urbanization, with 61.3% of Mauritanians living in urban centers as of 2024\.2 This concentration of population in areas like the capital, Nouakchott, creates immense pressure on resources, infrastructure, and social services.

The primary demographic tension arises from the ethnic composition: the Haratines (40%) and Beydane (30%) are Arab-speaking groups, while Sub-Saharan African groups (30%) speak various non-Arabic languages, creating a clear socio-economic and political division that often aligns with the historic slave/master distinction.3

### **B. Cultural Norms and Social Dynamics**

As an Islamic Republic, Islam is central to Mauritanian law and traditional customs.8 The country’s geographic position means it functions as a cultural bridge connecting the Arab-Amazigh Maghrib to the western sub-Saharan African populations.8 This location defines a complex national identity.

Traditional nomadic life, which once encompassed a large proportion of the population, has diminished significantly since the droughts of the 1970s, contributing to the accelerating urbanization trend.8 Gender roles remain traditional, reflected in the legal environment where a draft law addressing violence against women and girls has been stalled since 2016\.5

### **C. Linguistic Landscape**

The official language of Mauritania is Arabic.8 However, the linguistic environment is multilingual, with Fula, Soninke, and Wolof officially designated as national languages under the 1991 constitution.8 French, the language of the former colonial administration, remains widely used in media, commerce, and likely government bureaucracy.3

The socio-linguistic environment reinforces ethnic stratification. The dominance of Arabic and French in official and economic spheres likely creates a severe barrier for the 30% of the population comprising Sub-Saharan groups, whose primary languages are constitutionally recognized but often marginalized in practice.3 This language bias restricts access to education, employment, and political participation for non-Arabic speakers, thereby structurally impeding the realization of equitable human capital development goals.2

## **IV. Strategic Conclusions and Actionable Recommendations**

### **A. Synthesis of Interconnected Risks**

The analysis demonstrates that Mauritania's primary risks are systemic and interconnected, forming two self-reinforcing cycles:

**1\. The Governance and Exclusion Loop:** The political strategy relies on maximizing external economic legitimacy (via debt reduction and IMF adherence) while minimizing internal democratic accountability. This model mandates the suppression of dissent (via repressive laws and internet control) and, crucially, the structural continuation of socio-economic exclusion for the Haratin majority (via non-enforcement of anti-slavery laws).2 This stability is illusory, as structural inequality generates severe long-term fragility.

**2\. The Climate-Migration-Security Chain:** Environmental pressures, driven by aridity and desertification, reduce the viability of rural livelihoods (pastoralism).2 This compels internal migration, adding to the immense burden of external refugees and migrants, which then strains urban infrastructure and social safety nets.2 The resulting overcrowding and resource competition directly contribute to the observed rise in urban violent crime and resource competition.7

### **B. Policy Recommendations for International Partners**

1. **Conditionality on Judicial and Social Reform:** Financial aid and development support should be stringently conditioned on measurable progress in two specific areas: the immediate, transparent prosecution of slavery cases and the repeal of laws that weaponize speech (blasphemy, "false news") against political opponents.4 Programs must be established to ensure that formerly enslaved individuals are fully educated regarding their rights and processes for seeking redress.4  
2. **Integrated Migration and Urban Development Strategy:** Recognize that the migration crisis is fundamentally an urban planning challenge. Support must shift from merely managing refugee camps to investing heavily in the infrastructure, policing capacity, and public services of major urban centers, such as Nouakchott, to mitigate the social strain and high crime rates generated by rapid, unplanned population influx.2

### **C. Investment Recommendations and Risk Mitigation**

1. **Risk Management in Extractive Sectors:** Investment strategies in the resource sector (mining and nascent hydrocarbons) must incorporate a high-risk premium for political instability rooted in ethnic and economic inequality.3 Investors should implement advanced monitoring programs to ensure compliance with international anti-slavery and labor standards, given the documented failure of domestic legal enforcement.4  
2. **Targeted Digital Infrastructure Investment:** While generalized internet penetration is low and expensive, investment should target the high-potential NREN initiative.10 This represents an opportunity to enhance human capital and specialized R\&D. However, due diligence must account for the government's demonstrated willingness to impose digital blackouts for control purposes, necessitating resilience and contingency planning in digital operations.4  
3. **Comprehensive Security Planning:** Operational security planning must adopt a dual-threat approach. Security resources must be allocated not only for counter-terrorism efforts in high-risk zones but also for mitigating the elevated threat of organized and opportunistic violent crime targeting expatriates in urban environments.7 The assessment of police resource deficiencies must inform private security supplementation strategies.
