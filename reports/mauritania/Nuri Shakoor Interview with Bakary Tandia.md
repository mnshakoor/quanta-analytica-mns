Why we are here we are from Mauritania so the reason why we are here it is because of violations in Mauritania those violations take Miniforce number one slavery in Mauritania today we still have water modern day as slavery. We have people who are a slaved, and who are owned by their master black Mauritanian, who are owned by the members of the Arab ruling group in Mauritania and many bad things happen Number one in 1989 the government deported more than 60,000 opinions to Senegal and Bali. they still live in. You can go visit them them yourself and in 1990 9091\. They killed over 500 black soldiers and offices while in detention and we have a woman here. A husband was among those who got killed and until now This has not been served and what is really shocking in 1993 the national assembly of Virginia under the instruction of the president has an to protect. Those were involve in those crimes and we move from one violation to the order we have land propagation in the cynical river valley. The land belongs to black, but the government is trying to evict them and give that land to those who were rolling the country in 2011 something shocking will happen the civil registration system mailing all the civil registration papers issued before that day where you know every single Mauritanian has to go through the registration system again, pretending that you know, reliable civil registry, technically nothing wrong with that but the problem is, they turned that into an instrument of exclusion and discrimination so they put in place so many barriers for black Mauritanian to get reduced if you are not registered, you fall into state less less currently as I am speaking today we have many more genius who are Born in their parents were born in you know without citizenship in Mauritania and if you are not registered your children be registered if they are not registered they cannot go to school and there are so many types of humor right violation, discrimination, and what happened what is happening? It was officially the law. It was the law in. It is not in the law that we have a defect defect apart Can nobody candidate you know in order to cover all those maneuvers slavery, legally technically criminal, and Iâ€™m forcing them to different stories so that we are here to alert the international community about what is happening you know the governor Morrison has signed many international conventions and you know they must buy international lol I really appreciate Why we are here. We are from Mauritania so the reason why am from Cincinnati from different places because they see this opportunity a wonderful to share the information and mobilize about sharing information connecting with.
