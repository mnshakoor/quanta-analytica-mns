# Mauritania Quick Assessment 

As of September 2025, Mauritania faces several geopolitical tensions and challenges:

\*\*Regional Security and Border Incidents\*\*

\- In early 2025, Malian troops supported by Russian mercenaries pursued separatist fighters into Mauritania, resulting in the deaths of several Mauritanian civilians. This incident has strained relations between Mauritania and Mali, leading to unusual military drills near the border and heightened diplomatic tensions\[:refs\](7).

\- Mauritania has also faced criticism from Senegal and Mali for its treatment of migrants, including mass pushbacks and reports of torture and detention, which have sparked outrage among neighboring countries\[:refs\](8).

\*\*Internal Social and Political Tensions\*\*

\- The country’s ruling elite remains narrow and closed, and increased resources from mining and energy projects could either consolidate their power or exacerbate underlying social and political tensions. Ethnic and racial divisions, particularly between Arabic-speaking groups and non-Arabic-speaking black African communities, continue to simmer, occasionally erupting over issues like education, land tenure, and political representation\[:refs\](0,3).

\- Press freedom is restricted, and journalists risk arrest for reporting on sensitive topics, further limiting open discourse\[:refs\](2).

\*\*Energy and Economic Geopolitics\*\*

\- Mauritania’s emergence as an energy producer, especially with the launch of the Grand Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) gas project, has positioned it as a new geoeconomic actor. This shift attracts interest from global powers like China, Europe, and the Gulf states, but also exposes the country to risks from regional instability and competition over energy corridors\[:refs\](6).

\- The country’s economic outlook is favorable due to gas exports, but growth could be offset by geopolitical risks, including escalating tensions in the Sahel and potential disruptions to trade and investment

Diplomatic Shifts

\- There are indications that Mauritania may be moving toward normalization with Israel, which could reshape its regional alliances and further integrate it into Western-led initiatives in the Sahel

In summary, Mauritania’s geopolitical landscape is shaped by regional security threats, internal social divisions, economic opportunities from energy projects, and evolving diplomatic relationships. These factors create both opportunities and risks for the country’s stability and international standing. Would you like more detail on any specific aspect?

# Press Release: The Mauritania Diaspora in America for Human Rights Sounding the Alarm at the 80th Session of the UN General Assembly

On September 22-30, 2025, the 80" session of the UN General Assembly will convene.

The theme: "Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights raises the red flag on the challenges ahead. Human rights, the precondition to peace and development are in danger around the world. Mauritania, the last country to abolish slavery is no exception.

On this occasion, the Mauritanian Diaspora is sounding the alarm about the decades of gross human rights violations the citizens have been subjected to by their government.

Since 1986, the successive governments have engaged in widespread human rights violations against black Mauritanians which include continued Slavery, mass murders and deportations, racial discrimination, land expropriation, denial of citizenship and many more.

During the peak of the repression from 1989 \- 1991, more than 60,000 Black Mauritanians were deported to Senegal and Mali. These innocent Mauritanians are still living in refugee camps in those countries. To make the matter worst, in 1990-1991 more than 500 Black soldiers and officers were arbitrarily arrested and murder while in state custody. In addition, during this period countless numbers of black innocent citizens were murdered across the country.

These unabated racially motivated human rights violations take many forms. Black farmers' land continued to be expropriated. In 2011, the government introduced a biometric civil registration to reliably register their citizens.

Unfortunately, this has turned into a dreadful instrument of discrimination, which left thousands of Mauritanians without citizenship. Cultural and political oppression are an integral part of the state strategy to erase Black identity while denying the political rights of opposition leaders and restricting the right to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.

Shockingly, impunity is the rule. Not only are the perpetrators of such crimes protected from prosecution, but they are often promoted.

president of National Assembly who

faces serious allegations for crimes against humanity. With him in charge there is no hope for justice for the victims.

Furthermore, the cases of police violence are well documented. The killings of five young activists in Kaedi during the post electoral crisis in July 2024 and as recently as September 15, 2025, the police savagely attacked IRA members who tried to welcome President Biram Dah Abeid returned home from Paris. As usual these perpetrator remains unpunished.

Despite the recommendations of the UN Human Rights Council, the Mauritanian government has systematically refused to abide by its international obligations. Sizing on the UN 80" session to call upon the international community to pressure Mauritania on this matter. To address the situation, we demand that President Ghazouani and his government to:

Unconditionally release all political detainees, end arbitrary arrests, and detentions in inhumane conditions;

Respect the right the victims to justice, and repeal the 1993 amnesty, Law No. 93 \- 23 of June 14, 1993;

Diligently organize a just and fair return of Mauritanian refugees in Senegal and Mali;

Adopt effective policies to eradicate all forms of slavery, and stop violence against activists;

Protect the citizenship of all Mauritanians and ensure that they all are equally treated.
