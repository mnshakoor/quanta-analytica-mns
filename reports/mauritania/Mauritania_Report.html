    <!-- Chosen Palette: Analyst Neutral (Stone background, dark text, ochre/slate accents) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic SPA with persistent side navigation (Overview, Risk Dashboard, Data Explorer, Scenarios, Context, Recommendations, AI Assistant). This structure deconstructs the dense report into user-driven, explorable modules, prioritizing key takeaways and interactive data visualization over the original linear format. The goal is to allow different user types (e.g., a policy maker wanting a quick overview vs. an analyst wanting to dig into data) to find information efficiently. The AI Assistant section is added as a new module to provide dynamic, on-demand summarization and Q&A powered by an LLM. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: CARVER Risk Matrix -> Goal: Inform/Compare -> Viz: Interactive Cards with color-coded scores -> Interaction: Click to expand for details. Justification: More engaging & less overwhelming than a large table. Library: HTML/CSS/JS. Report Info: BTI, V-Dem, FSI, ACLED time-series data -> Goal: Show Change/Trends -> Viz: Line Charts -> Interaction: Dropdown to select specific indicators, updating chart and descriptive text. Justification: Allows direct exploration of the report's evidence base. Library: Chart.js. Report Info: Future Scenarios -> Goal: Compare possibilities -> Viz: Interactive Cards -> Interaction: Click to view details/triggers. Justification: Clearly separates and explains potential outcomes. Library: HTML/CSS/JS. Report Info: Entire Report Text -> Goal: Summarize & Answer Questions -> Viz: Dynamic Text Block -> Interaction: User prompt, button click. Justification: Provides a new, powerful layer of interactivity for synthesizing complex information quickly. Library: Gemini API via Fetch. -->

                            <p class="mb-4">Mauritania remains in a fragile equilibrium characterized by low democratic quality, entrenched grievances, and persistent human rights violations. The government's reputation for "stability" increasingly relies on coercive suppression rather than institutional resilience.</p>

                                The data converge: weak governance (BTI, V-Dem), high fragility (FSI), and rising political violence (ACLED). The combination points to a brittle state more vulnerable than its external partners assume.

                            <p>The recent diaspora protest at the UN General Assembly highlights a widening gap between international perceptions and the internal lived reality. Systemic exclusion of Black Mauritanians, impunity for past atrocities, and escalating repression have severely eroded the government's legitimacy. This protest serves as a critical data point, aligning with empirical evidence of fragility and signaling a potential shift in how international partners engage with Mauritania, possibly moving from a "stability-first" to a "rights-first" approach.</p>

        Executive Summary
        Mauritania remains in a fragile equilibrium: low democratic quality, entrenched grievances, persistent human rights violations, and growing signs of political unrest. The government continues to enjoy a reputation of “stability” in external partnerships, especially with the EU (migration management) and Sahel counter-terrorism frameworks, yet this stability increasingly relies on coercive suppression rather than institutional resilience. The diaspora protest at the UNGA underscores a widening gap between international perceptions and internal lived reality, where systemic exclusion of Black Mauritanians, impunity for past atrocities, and escalating repression have eroded legitimacy. The data converge: weak governance (BTI, V-Dem), high fragility (FSI), and rising political violence (ACLED). The combination points to a brittle state more vulnerable than its external partners assume.
        
        Context and Drivers
        Understanding Mauritania's current risk profile requires acknowledging the deep historical and structural factors that shape its political landscape. These core drivers fuel the grievances visualized in the data and create the conditions for the scenarios outlined. From unresolved historical atrocities to systemic discrimination, these issues form the foundation of the country's fragility.
        Historical Legacy: The 1989–1991 deportations, massacres, and arbitrary killings of Black Mauritanians remain a deep, unhealed wound. The passage of Amnesty Law 93-23 has ensured impunity for perpetrators, preventing transitional justice and embedding grievance at the heart of the nation's identity politics.
        Structural Exclusion: Persistent ethnic discrimination is institutionalized through various state mechanisms. The 2011 biometric registration system has been widely criticized for systematically denying citizenship to Black Mauritanians. This, combined with ongoing land dispossession, fuels the high "Group Grievance" scores seen in the FSI data.
        Shrinking Political Space: The government actively suppresses dissent. Opposition parties, civil society activists, and particularly anti-slavery groups like the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA), face routine repression, arbitrary detention, and police violence. This stifles internal channels for peaceful change.
        Geopolitical Role & Socioeconomic Pressures: International partners, especially the EU and US, prioritize Mauritania's role in stability and counter-terrorism, often shielding the regime in Nouakchott from stronger human rights pressure. This external dynamic intersects with severe internal socioeconomic pressures like high unemployment, climate stress, and weak public services, compounding the population's vulnerability and discontent.
        
        Data-Grounded Recommendations
        The following recommendations are derived directly from the report's findings and are tailored for different stakeholders. They focus on leveraging data for more effective monitoring, advocacy, and risk mitigation, with the goal of shifting the international approach from one that enables brittle stability to one that promotes genuine, rights-based resilience.
        For Analysts and Monitors: Develop Indicator Dashboards: Track BTI, V-Dem, FSI, and ACLED data quarterly, using specific thresholds (e.g., ACLED annual events >15) as triggers for escalation warnings. Triangulate Claims: Systematically cross-validate claims from diaspora and activist groups with quantitative data spikes in V-Dem equality indicators and ACLED protest/repression events.
        For Advocacy Groups: Bundle Evidence: Frame advocacy messages by combining powerful narratives (like the Kaédi killings) with hard data, such as the ACLED 2024 peak and V-Dem's negative equality scores. Target Policy Levers: Focus campaigns on concrete, measurable demands like the repeal of Amnesty Law 93-23 and verifiable reforms to the biometric citizenship system. Counter the Narrative: Actively use data showing repression-driven fragility to challenge the "stable partner" narrative often used by the government and its allies.
        For Risk Mitigation & Donor Engagement: Protect Communities: Increase monitoring and protective presence in high-risk towns like Kaédi, which have proven to be flashpoints for state violence. Provide Legal Defense: Prioritize resources for the legal defense of activists targeted for detention, as this is a primary tool of state repression. Advocate for Conditionality: Engage with donor governments and institutions to tie development and security aid to measurable improvements in human rights indicators.

            interpretation: "The Liberal Democracy Index, which measures protections for individual and minority rights, is extremely low and flat. This indicates that even when elections occur, the fundamental pillars of a liberal democracy—such as rule of law and civil liberties—are critically weak, confirming claims of an authoritarian system."

            interpretation: "While showing some marginal gains over the years, the Electoral Democracy Index remains in the bottom global quartile.

            interpretation: "This indicator remains severely negative throughout the period, providing the starkest quantitative evidence of the systemic discrimination central to the report.

            interpretation: "The BTI Status Index, measuring the state of democracy and market economy, shows Mauritania is in the 'very limited' transformation category. The long-term flat trend demonstrates a complete lack of structural improvement, indicating that episodic reforms have failed to alter the country's underlying exclusionary governance."

This rise, driven by protest repression, is a key early-warning signal that the state's 'stability' is becoming more coercive and brittle."
