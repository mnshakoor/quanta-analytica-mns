### **Mauritania Anti-slavery Notes** ###

***Introduction***
Mauritania was the last country globally to abolish slavery in 1981, with full criminalization occurring in 2007 and further strengthening in 2015, designating it a crime against humanity. Despite these measures, descent-based chattel slavery persists, affecting an estimated 149,000 people—primarily Haratines (Black Moors)—through forced labor, domestic servitude, herding, and sexual exploitation. Enforcement remains inconsistent, marked by government denial, limited prosecutions, and repression of activists, though 2024–2025 saw incremental reforms like a new specialized court and national action plan.

***Legal Framework***
⦁	Key Legislation: The 2007 anti-slavery law introduced penalties of 5–10 years imprisonment; the 2015 revision escalated sentences to 10–20 years, established specialized anti-slavery courts, and required victim restitution. The 2020 anti-trafficking law addresses related forced labor and child begging, often intertwined with slavery.
⦁	Recent Reforms: In February 2025, the government consolidated three anti-slavery courts and ordinary trafficking courts into a single specialized court under Judge El Sheikh Sid Mohamed Ould Cheyna, aiming to standardize prosecutions for slavery, trafficking, and migrant smuggling. A pending bill seeks further judicial reforms for these courts.
⦁	Actionable Insight: The specialized court could enhance efficiency if resourced, but its success hinges on independence from political interference, offering NGOs an entry point for judicial training partnerships.

***Enforcement Mechanisms***
⦁	Institutional Bodies: The National Agency to Combat Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling (INCHTMS) coordinates efforts, including victim identification and a national referral mechanism (NRM) adopted in 2024. The Commissariat for Human Rights, Humanitarian Action, and Relations with Civil Society (CDHAHRSC) partners with NGOs like SOS-Esclaves for awareness and support.
⦁	National Action Plan (NAP): Approved in March 2024, the 2024–2026 NAP allocates 35 million MRU (~$893,770) for victim protection, perpetrator accountability, and training; it includes studies on trafficking in illegal gold mining and capacity-building for enforcement officials.
⦁	Training and Awareness: In 2024, the Ministry of Justice allocated ~$850,000 for training on slavery and trafficking laws; INCHTMS developed victim identification modules and conducted campaigns, leading to cases like the identification of eight Malian girls in forced domestic work.
⦁	Actionable Insight: Investors in mining/agriculture should fund INCHTMS-led trainings to mitigate supply chain risks, aligning with ILO Conventions ratified by Mauritania.

***Prosecutions and Convictions***
⦁	2023–2024 Statistics: Under the 2020 anti-trafficking law, authorities initiated 23 investigations (up from 14), prosecuted 10 suspects, and convicted nine (seven with 3–15 year sentences, two suspended). Under the 2015 anti-slavery law, nine prosecutions led to five convictions (2–20 years, plus restitution of $2,555–$25,535), though two were in absentia or settled informally (prohibited).
⦁	Notable Cases: First conviction of three Senegalese Quranic teachers for child forced begging; an appeal overturned a hereditary slavery conviction, pending Supreme Court review. Only five slavery convictions since 2015, with minimal sentences (none over two years served).
⦁	Child Labor Link: In 2024, 11 investigations into worst forms of child labor (often slavery-like) resulted in two convictions; Haratine children face hereditary enslavement in herding and domestic work.
⦁	Actionable Insight: Low conviction rates signal weak deterrence; policy analysts can advocate for Supreme Court prioritization of appeals to set precedents.

***Victim Support and Identification***
⦁	Identification Efforts: INCHTMS identified 105 victims in 2023–2024 (up from 89), including 83 children in forced begging, eight in domestic servitude, and 14 in other forms; services reached 91 via NGOs, with a victims' fund allocating 8.1 million MRU (~$206,845) for 50 hereditary slavery cases.
⦁	Support Services: Government centers aid vulnerable children and women, but adult male victims lack adequate care; civil society fills gaps, assisting escapes and lawsuits.
⦁	Challenges in Reach: No proactive screening for hereditary slavery victims, who self-report via NGOs; unidentified victims risk detention/deportation.
⦁	Actionable Insight: NGOs should expand community-based screening in Haratine areas, integrating with the NRM to boost identification by 20–30% annually.

***Challenges and Barriers***
⦁	Government Denial and Repression: Officials routinely deny slavery's existence, retaliating against exposers; since April 2025, a wave of arrests targeted IRA-Mauritania activists, including MP Gamou Achour (beaten unconscious May 20), journalist Warda Ahmed Souleymane, and others for protests and advocacy, violating international covenants.
⦁	Institutional Weaknesses: Anti-slavery courts lack resources, staff, and training, leading to misclassifications and informal settlements; corruption/complicity among officials (e.g., in smuggling) hampers probes. Traditional jurors and witness intimidation deter cases.
⦁	Socio-Economic Factors: Descent-based exclusion perpetuates vulnerability; urban wage theft and rural hereditary practices persist, with ~90,000 victims estimated in older data.
⦁	Actionable Insight: For security advisors, monitor activist arrests as unrest indicators; investors must conduct human rights due diligence per UN Guiding Principles to avoid complicity.
Recent Developments (2024–2025)
⦁	Positive Steps: NAP approval (March 2024), specialized court launch (February 2025), and U.S. reinstatement of trade preferences (January 2024) signal progress; Global Slavery Index notes decline to 149,000 slaves.
⦁	Setbacks: Escalating repression in Teyarett (May 2025 protests violently dispersed), ongoing denials (e.g., President Ghazouani's 2023 campaign rhetoric vs. reality), and minimal child labor advancements.
⦁	International Scrutiny: UN Rapporteur (July 2023) highlighted awareness gaps; U.S. TIP Report (2024) notes increased efforts but Tier 3 placement risks due to enforcement shortfalls.
⦁	Actionable Insight: EU/U.S. aid conditions on activist protections could accelerate reforms; track September 2025 UN reviews for leverage.
International Perspectives and Corporate Implications
⦁	Global Views: UN and Amnesty emphasize redress gaps; U.S. State Department critiques expression curbs and assembly restrictions tied to anti-slavery advocacy.
⦁	Corporate Due Diligence: High-risk sectors like dairy (e.g., Tiviski) must trace supply chains for slave labor, per OECD-FAO guidelines; failure risks reputational/financial harm.
⦁	Actionable Insight: Investment advisors recommend third-party audits for extractives/agriculture; NGOs can partner with corporates for remediation funds.

## Recommendations
⦁	For Policy Analysts: Lobby for INCHTMS empowerment and anti-corruption probes to enforce NAP fully.
⦁	For NGOs: Prioritize survivor-centered legal aid and digital advocacy to evade repression.
⦁	For Investors: Integrate slavery risk assessments into ESG frameworks, supporting court resourcing via public-private partnerships.
Overall, while 2025 reforms offer hope, sustained international pressure is essential to translate laws into eradication, potentially reducing prevalence by 20% by 2030 with robust implementation.
